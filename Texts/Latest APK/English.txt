RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. As you know, I do a lot of research. There are just so many Pokémon to learn about and document!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Recently, I’ve been investigating Ralts, the Feeling Pokémon, to learn more about how this Pokémon senses people’s emotions by using the horns on its head.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: It’s an amazing ability, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I thought studying this Pokémon’s unique sensing powers could help me identify the strange feeling that’s been stirring inside me these past few weeks.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’ve realized, though, that this isn’t any ordinary emotion—it’s a type of energy!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: This mysterious energy is filling me with hope and determination. I feel like I could take on any challenge and be victorious!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: I would appreciate your assistance in collecting more information on this strange and fascinating phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing the research we needed to get started, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: While you were catching Pokémon and visiting PokéStops, I started digging through my research and found references to a phenomenon that seems to have a lot in common with what I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The reports refer to a Mythical Pokémon that shares the infinite energy it creates with others to guarantee victory.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: The reports also state that this Pokémon is Psychic- and Fire-type. What an amazing combination!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: To get closer to confirming the source of the energy, let’s focus our efforts on catching Pokémon that share those same types.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts researching Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, we’re well on our way to confirming the source of this mysterious energy.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There’s many a mystery surrounding our path forward, so I’ll keep poring over our research notes. In the meantime, I’d like you to work on becoming better friends with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: As a Trainer, strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon is an important task that requires a specific set of skills.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: To further develop those skills, why don’t you try spending time with your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Successful partnerships take work and dedication, and talented Trainers build lifelong friendships with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: That being said, be sure to spend time with your buddy every day!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: You have a wonderful bond with your buddy, Trainer! It’s been a treat watching that friendship bloom. Now, though, it’s time to focus our efforts on the matter at hand!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: After further examination of the research you completed, I’m convinced that the Pokémon we’re looking for is Victini, the Victory Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only would this be consistent with the references to a Psychic- and Fire-type Pokémon, but it would also explain the mysterious surge of energy I’ve been experiencing.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: It’s time for you to befriend Victini. Since this Pokémon represents victory, I think winning a few battles might inspire it to come forward!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: I’ve been hearing reports that Team GO Rocket is causing trouble. Battling these troublemakers just might show this Pokémon you’re worthy of attention!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Let’s see whether some victory will attract the Victory Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Absolutely astounding, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d be able to display your powerful bonds and battle prowess to impress the Mythical Pokémon Victini.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It shares the infinite energy it creates when its body overflows with power, so I’m absolutely certain now that the energy I was feeling was coming directly from Victini!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Be sure to use this power wisely, %PLAYERNAME%, as you and Victini take on new challenges. But for now, your hard work calls for a celebration!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Why don’t you take a few snapshots with Victini and share your success with fellow Trainers by sending them some Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: Once again, you have helped me uncover a huge discovery. I cannot thank you enough for your time and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is filled with endless discoveries, and it isn’t every day we come across a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I hope that you will take the lessons we learned together through this investigation and apply them to your training.

RESOURCE ID: global_victini_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I’m proud of you, %PLAYERNAME%, and hope you continue to strive to be your very best. Until next time, let’s GO!

TEXT: Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2020, %PLAYERNAME%! GO Fest this year is a little bit different from previous years, but it’ll be just as fun—and challenging!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an amazing phenomenon—it seems as though different Pokémon are appearing in the area on what seems an hourly basis. I need your help collecting data on this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_10
TEXT: We’ll have another fun-filled day tomorrow. For now, I’m going to start looking into this situation. Perhaps it’s related to a powerful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_11
TEXT: Now, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m sure you know what I’m going to say next.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_12
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: I thought it would be fun to give you some tasks to help you research this phenomenon. I’ll make sure you get a reward for your hard work!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: Don’t delay—since different Pokémon seem to be appearing each hour, you have limited time to complete these tasks! You can see Trainers’ progress by checking the Global Challenge Arena.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: To help with your research, be sure to use Incense to attract Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_5
TEXT: Remember, you can now activate several Incense at once and have them attract Pokémon to you for hours! Incense smells amazing, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_6
TEXT: It brings a smile to my face knowing that millions of Trainers around the world are working together right now because of their shared love of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_7
TEXT: Furthermore, I’ve been sensing a great energy that has filled me with hope and determination. Have you been feeling it as well?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_8
TEXT: I wonder whether it’s connected to the strange happenings that kicked off our research this weekend.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_dialogue_0_9
TEXT: I have a feeling today’s just the beginning of an exciting adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_title
TEXT: GO Fest 2020: Welcome!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_habitat_title_0
TEXT: GO Fest 2020: Welcome! (1/1)

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, by the look on your face, I’m sure you’ve grasped the situation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket confetti is raining down from the sky. Grunts are invading PokéStops all around the world. And...Team GO Rocket has taken over Pokémon GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: We thought we put a stop to them when we ended their take-over during our research leading up to GO Fest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_3
TEXT: But that take-over appears to have been only part of a larger plan. We have yet to determine Team GO Rocket’s ultimate goal, though. Regardless of what it is, %PLAYERNAME%...you must prepare yourself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_0_4
TEXT: I’m impressed by your energy and that of your fellow Trainers around the world! If we work together, I know victory is within our reach!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Pokémon are ready for battle, and I bet your fellow Trainers are thankful for the supplies you’ve sent their way. We’ll need to work together to keep Team GO Rocket at bay and save Pokémon GO Fest!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Oh, what’s this? Looks like the snapshots you took feature some unwelcome guests! It’s amazing that Team GO Rocket can organize these massive take-overs, but its members do seem a little silly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe these photobombs are actually all a part of their scheme? Anyway, why don’t you put all your training to use? In the meantime, I’ll do some more investigating with the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, you’ve caught a Golem!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been scoping out the Team GO Rocket balloons and have discovered that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are using Flying-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Sources told me that Team GO Rocket might’ve captured some Legendary Pokémon and turned them into Shadow Pokémon, too!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: If I recall correctly, the team leaders saw one of these balloons at GO Fest last year—and another during the Team GO Rocket take-over a few weeks ago.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t have imagined that Team GO Rocket would spend resources on such an...interesting means of transportation. However, it’s clear that the boss has put a lot of effort into providing his Grunts with balloons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Your Golem might be a helpful addition to your battle party, since Flying types are weak to Rock-type attacks! %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to rock Team GO Rocket’s world and save those Legendary Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo. Now all that’s left is their boss, Giovanni. %PLAYERNAME%, are you ready?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela can handle the Team GO Rocket Leaders while you prepare to face the boss. It’s interesting that the Team GO Rocket Leaders are commanding these Legendary Shadow Pokémon, which are usually reserved for the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll learn what this means as we uncover Team GO Rocket’s devious plans and discover what Pokémon Giovanni now has under his control.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: On the bright side, I received an encouraging message from the team leaders about a mysterious phenomenon. Remember that powerful energy I detected yesterday?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: The team leaders reported that Trainers worldwide suddenly felt a similar energy that filled them with hope and determination. Through my research, I found references to that very same energy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: They document a Mythical Pokémon that shares its infinite energy with others and guarantees a winning battle. I have a feeling that’s why Team GO Rocket is here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Perhaps Team GO Rocket hopes to further its dastardly plans by using this powerful Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: I hear Giovanni often begins his battles with his Buddy Pokémon, Persian, which is weak to Fighting-type attacks. The Machamp you caught earlier might help you here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. The fate of Pokémon GO Fest is in your hands.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you did it! You defeated Giovanni and sent him packing! Who would’ve thought that he could turn even Mewtwo into a Shadow Pokémon? That alone is a mystery we need to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: It was a tough battle, and the fact that you defeated Mewtwo proves what an amazing Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela were victorious against the Team GO Rocket Leaders and drove them away, too.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Thanks to everyone’s efforts, we’ve saved Pokémon GO Fest! It’s time to celebrate!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Turns out, Team GO Rocket was after Victini, the Victory Pokémon! Some say this Pokémon brings victory to its Trainer, regardless of the contest.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: I’m now sure that the energy we were all feeling was thanks to Victini. I’m in utter awe of your tenacity and determination. Pokémon GO Fest was saved because of your hard work. Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Phew! Now, I think we should get back to having fun. There’s still time to enjoy the festivities!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: While this year’s GO Fest was quite a bit different from previous ones, I’m overjoyed that Trainers all over the world could still come together to celebrate—and protect—our beloved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: Even when we’re apart, we’re still united by our love of Pokémon. No matter what obstacles appear in your path, you can always count on your Pokémon and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2020_quest_rocket_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: I know we’ll all meet again under the same sky someday, so until then...let’s GO!

TEXT: Pokémon GO Fest 2022

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_1
TEXT: It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_10
TEXT: Perhaps we should patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_11
TEXT: I have also not forgotten about your missing professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_12
TEXT: Others have also expressed distress over his absence—specifically, a fiery woman with short brown hair.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_13
TEXT: She hypothesized that participating in Pokémon battles could shed some light on your companion’s whereabouts. As for how, I cannot say... But I trust her expertise on the matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_14
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_2
TEXT: Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_3
TEXT: I lost myself in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_4
TEXT: I notice your fellows are gathering en masse.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_5
TEXT: Am I to understand this is typical for the Pokémon Trainers of your world?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_6
TEXT: So it is a festival. I see.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_7
TEXT: And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_8
TEXT: Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_1_9
TEXT: If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_1
TEXT: This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_10
TEXT: After you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_2
TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_3
TEXT: If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_4
TEXT: A shame. Moving on—you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_5
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_6
TEXT: An irradiant image. I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_7
TEXT: In a less eventful time, I would study Shaymin to see such a shine for myself.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_8
TEXT: But I must temper my enthusiasm. An Ultra Wormhole could appear at any moment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_2_9
TEXT: We should continue our patrol.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Nihilego is no longer this world’s sole Ultra Beast.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_2
TEXT: I have just observed UB-02 Beauty—Pheromosa, to some humans—emerge from a freshly formed Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_3
TEXT: Although it is a common organism in the world it calls home, it is a danger here.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_4
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_5
TEXT: Luckily, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_6
TEXT: Just be warned that this Ultra Beast is not easily subdued.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_7
TEXT: That is why I have prepared some Beast Balls for you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_8
TEXT: They are a type of ball specifically designed to capture Ultra Beasts. I hope they prove useful.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_3_9
TEXT: Now, if you will attend to catching Pheromosa, I will focus on reconnaissance. Let us go, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_1
TEXT: You impress me yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_10
TEXT: If you take snapshots of the unique locations in this area, we can scrutinize them together.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_2
TEXT: The ease with which you handle Ultra Beasts is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_3
TEXT: Even in the face of immense danger, I might add.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_4
TEXT: I am endlessly fascinated by you.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_5
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_6
TEXT: While you battled, I had a thought.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_7
TEXT: Your photographic observations—can they be used in other ways, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_8
TEXT: For example: if you were to take snapshots of the surrounding areas, do you think that might help us identify anomalies we’d otherwise miss if we relied only on our eyes?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_4_9
TEXT: It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_1
TEXT: Thank you for your diligence, Pokémon Trainer. I will take your snapshots for further study.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_10
TEXT: We will surely find him. I will prioritize the study of your snapshots and conduct further reconnaissance on my own time—it is the least I can do in return for all that you have done for me.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_11
TEXT: Until I uncover a clue, let us turn our attention back to the subject of food.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_12
TEXT: Would it benefit us to feed Pheromosa, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_13
TEXT: Perhaps the positive properties of this world’s Poffins affect Ultra Beasts as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_14
TEXT: However, Pheromosa seems reticent to engage—almost as if this world disagrees with its notion of cleanliness.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_15
TEXT: An experiment, then: let us place a Poffin on the ground so we may observe its reaction.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_16
TEXT: From a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_2
TEXT: What is that in your other hand—a Poffin? Are you hungry?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_3
TEXT: Hm. We have been walking for a while.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_4
TEXT: Let us rest, then.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_5
TEXT: Perhaps your Pokémon is also in need of nourishment.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_6
TEXT: And while we are on the subject: what distinguishes Pokémon food from human food?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_7
TEXT: Your professor would have such answers? I should have known—his juice-stained coat speaks of an affinity for Berries.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_8
TEXT: Do you think he—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_5_9
TEXT: Apologies. It was tactless of me to speak of Willow when you are anxious about his safety.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_1
TEXT: What an oddly enjoyable endeavor, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_10
TEXT: The more we learn, the less there is to fear.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_11
TEXT: I suspect Willow feels much the sa—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_12
TEXT: Wait. Another anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_2
TEXT: Your Pokémon are lucky to have such a reliable guardian.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_3
TEXT: I’m sure they are grateful. As am I.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_4
TEXT: This entire situation would have been troublesome for me to handle alone.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_5
TEXT: Our time together has taught me much.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_6
TEXT: While you were tending to your Pokémon, I detected a promising signal from within Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_7
TEXT: It is not much, but I believe it is connected to your professor.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_8
TEXT: I hope this provides you with some degree of solace.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_6_9
TEXT: Knowledge is the great illuminator.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_10
TEXT: But enough talk. The light of your festival beckons.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_11
TEXT: Thank you for sharing this experience with me today.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_12
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_2
TEXT: And from within this light emerges another form.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_4
TEXT: You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_5
TEXT: I am flattered it deemed me worthy.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_6
TEXT: And I hope I may continue to be a worthy companion to you as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_7
TEXT: With UB-02 Beauty safely in your care and no other Ultra Beasts emerging, I will release you to partake in your festivities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_8
TEXT: Meanwhile, I will resume my investigation into Willow’s whereabouts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_berlin_7_9
TEXT: There is yet more to do.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer! I have a positive update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_2
TEXT: After analyzing the data we collected from the Ultra Wormholes, I have located—and retrieved—Professor Willow from Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_3
TEXT: His return would not have been possible without your exhaustive efforts.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_4
TEXT: I do not doubt you are eager to speak with him, but he requires rest before your reunion.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_5
TEXT: Following that, I would appreciate your assistance with another matter.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_6
TEXT: UB-01 Symbiont and UB-02 Beauty—that is, Nihilego and Pheromosa—have once again returned to this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_7
TEXT: I need not emphasize what dangers they pose.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_8
TEXT: Additionally, new signals indicate that other Ultra Beasts may soon follow.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_1_9
TEXT: But first, your professor. You and I can reconvene after you two have spoken.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_1

%PLAYERNAME%? Is...that you?
How long has it been? It’s good to see you. I’ve had the most amazing adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_2
TEXT: There I was, pondering the mysteries of the island guardians—and moping a little at my misfortune, I must admit—when a glowing portal appeared out of thin air!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_3
TEXT: I couldn’t help wondering what was on the other side. My curiosity ignited, I weighed the risks, grabbed my gear, and jumped right in!

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_4
TEXT: The portal led to a completely different dimension—one traversed by unimaginably strange creatures...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_1_2_5
TEXT: I must tell you all about it! *yawn* But before I do, I could use a little nap. I promise I’ll spare no detail after I’ve slept...a few...
*snore*

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_1
TEXT: Welcome back, Pokémon Trainer. I hope you had a pleasant reunion with your professor. Has he fallen asleep? Understandable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_2
TEXT: You and I can turn our attention to the Ultra Beasts while he recuperates.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_3
TEXT: I have confirmed the reappearance of UB-02 Absorption, Buzzwole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_4
TEXT: Buzzwole’s propensity for displaying its robust musculature remains a mystery—is it mere self-satisfaction or some kind of threat?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_5
TEXT: Its sturdy physique stands in contrast to Pheromosa’s lithe frame.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_finale_2_1_6
TEXT: Though neither should be underestimated.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_10

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_13

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_3

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_4

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_5

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_1_6

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_3
TEXT: But I digress. Have you seen any additional anomalies on your patrol?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_4
TEXT: In an area this large, I cannot pinpoint the exact location from which an Ultra Wormhole will originate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_5
TEXT: We can only rely on our own visual surveillance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_6
TEXT: I wonder if the items provided by your PokéStops might help us prepare for the Ultra Wormhole’s impending arrival.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_2_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Indulge me in a moment of introspection.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_2

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_3_3

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_1

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_10

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_2
TEXT: The appearance of an Ultra Beast is imminent.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_3
TEXT: Fortunately, you and I have a history of contending with such situations.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_4
TEXT: My data indicates that the Ultra Beast most likely to appear is UB-02 Absorption.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_5
TEXT: Some humans call it Buzzwole. It seems to enjoy displaying its robust musculature.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_6
TEXT: It must not be allowed to wreak havoc.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_4_7

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_2
TEXT: The ease with which you handled Buzzwole is enviable. It is a technique unfamiliar to me, and yet it comes to you naturally.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_3
TEXT: Now, I have an update to share.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_4
TEXT: I detected an odd signal when Buzzwole emerged from the Ultra Wormhole.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_6
TEXT: Using it, I can better investigate where within Ultra Space your Professor Willow may be.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_city_5_7
TEXT: I will continue to do what I can to expedite his recovery.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer. Good...morning? Or is it the evening?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_10
TEXT: Perhaps we should both patrol the area to familiarize ourselves with its geography and identify any emerging irregularities.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_11
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us begin.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_2
TEXT: I am still growing accustomed to the cycles of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_3
TEXT: But enough about time—let us focus on space. Prior to your arrival, I was surveying the area for Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_4
TEXT: Though I find myself getting lost in the atmosphere around us.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_5
TEXT: Trainers are gathering here en masse...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_6
TEXT: Ah. So it’s a festival to celebrate the Pokémon Trainers of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_7
TEXT: And since you are present, I assume you mean to participate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_8
TEXT: Do enjoy, then. But I would caution you to stay alert.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_1_9
TEXT: If an Ultra Beast were to appear amid such a gathering, chaos would ensue.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_1
TEXT: It is beautiful here. Dazzlingly so...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_2
TEXT: Ah. You have once again caught me in a moment of reverie, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_3
TEXT: I am continually struck by the radiance of this world.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_4
TEXT: Back home—it is dark.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_5
TEXT: You and your fellows are fortunate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_6
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_2_7
TEXT: We should continue our patrol. After you, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_1
TEXT: This place has drawn a remarkable number of Pokémon—an astounding example of regional biodiversity.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_2
TEXT: One even attempted to approach me. Your world’s Pokémon offer friendship so effortlessly. If only the Ultra Beasts were as amiable.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_3
TEXT: I have seen—let me consult my notes—Lapras, Skorupi, Litwick, Rufflet...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_4
TEXT: Even my idle time has been illuminating. I discovered that Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_5
TEXT: I noted this phenomenon from a distance.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_6
TEXT: Another benefit of your photographic observations. What else can be safely documented through them?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_3_7
TEXT: Taking snapshots of the unique locations in this area might answer this. It is “worth a shoot,” at any rate.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_1
TEXT: Pokémon Trainer, you mentioned that you and Willow were pursuing the Pokémon Shaymin before his disappearance, correct?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_2
TEXT: I recently overheard another Pokémon Trainer say that “upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light, and its tiny body transforms.”

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_3
TEXT: An irradiant image.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_4
TEXT: I wonder if this transformation is akin to Evolution or if it is something else entirely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_5
TEXT: There is so much I do not know about Pokémon, and yet you gift your knowledge to me freely.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_6
TEXT: Our time together has taught me much, and for that, I—

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_4_7
TEXT: Wait. An anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pokémon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_1
TEXT: So, I have seen Shaymin and its transformative light.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_2
TEXT: And from within this light emerges another form.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_3
TEXT: What a resplendent revelation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_6
TEXT: You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_7
TEXT: I am pleased that it recognizes my appreciation.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_8
TEXT: And I hope that appreciation is apparent to you as well.

RESOURCE ID: gofest2022_seattle_park_5_9
TEXT: With no proximate threat, you should return to your festival. I will keep watch.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#2
TEXT: I’m impressed that you got by my leaders, Trainer, but nothing will prepare you for my Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_greeting#3

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_giovanni_victory#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_challenge#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_grunt_defeat#1

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#2
TEXT: I know I’ll be disappointed in your battling, so let’s just get this over with.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_challenge#3
TEXT: Might as well pass the time with a battle, considering your little event is ruined.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#1
TEXT: This must be a mistake. Failure isn’t an option.

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_defeat#2

RESOURCE ID: gofest_sierra_greeting#1

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Check this out—I’ve been practicing.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon GO! My name is Willow. People call me the Pokémon Prof!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: This world is inhabited by creatures called Pokémon! Some people keep Pokémon as companions. Others have them do battle. Myself? I study Pokémon as a profession.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: Did that remind you of anyone? For many years, Trainers from Kanto have heard similar remarks before embarking on their journeys through the region.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I have the honor of making them today because you’re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: But we can’t have you leaving unprepared! I’ve put together some supplies I think you’ll find useful.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Berries, Potions, and Poké Balls. Looks like you’re all set!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: As you begin today’s adventure, try to imagine you’re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I have a feeling you’ll meet a Pokémon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pokémon you encounter along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: On adventures, I find it’s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I’m sure you’ll make plenty of both!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pokémon awaits! Let's GO!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: How’s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pokémon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pokémon, #001 in the Pokédex. This Grass-type Pokémon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it’s born.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pokémon. It’s a Fire-type Pokémon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Last—but certainly not least—is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pokémon. After birth, this Water-type Pokémon's back swells and hardens into a shell.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: Each of these Pokémon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it’s time to get back to your adventure.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: I’d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon is of utmost importance!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you’re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you’ll become even closer in no time.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Not only are the relationships you build with your Pokémon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you’re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I’m sure they’d love to hear from you!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pokémon you might not have otherwise encountered.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_2
TEXT: And not only do you get a new entry in your Pokédex, but you also get a new friend!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: You’ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it’s time to show off the skills you’ve learned along the way!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pokémon? Don’t forget to make use of your Berries, too.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_5
TEXT: I’m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pokémon you’re catching—and they’re tasty to boot!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_0
TEXT: I’m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: I’ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I’m very impressed! It seems there’s no challenge you can’t overcome.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: As I’m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pokémon in raids.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pokémon and bolster your team.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_4
TEXT: While you focus on that, I’ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_5
TEXT: There have been reports of encounters with a Pokémon that’s able to transform into another Pokémon entirely. Fascinating stuff!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_6
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_0
TEXT: Glad you’re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_2
TEXT: However, there seems to be something more to this situation.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_3
TEXT: Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_4
TEXT: I’ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I’m stunned!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_1
TEXT: You’ve had quite the journey, haven’t you? It’s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, though, there’s still another mystery that needs solving.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: You see, after looking over the research you’ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pokémon, Mew.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: We've documented Mew in the past, but something’s different this time—though I can’t yet say what that is.

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: Whatever the case, I think it’s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_6
TEXT: In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I’m sure you’re up to it!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_7
TEXT: For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today’s Kanto-themed journey!

RESOURCE ID: gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_8
TEXT: I hope you were able to make some special memories with your Pokémon and fellow Trainers. Thanks again for all your help and hard work!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Thank you for all your help with Gyarados and Celebi, %PLAYERNAME%. Though it seems our work isn’t over yet—Team GO Rocket still has Lugia and Ho-Oh.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: With the team leaders’ help, we managed to pinpoint Apex Shadow Ho-Oh’s location. For reasons unknown, Team GO Rocket’s keeping the two Pokémon in separate locations.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Perhaps they’ve bitten off more than they can chew with these two Legendary Pokémon? In any case, this makes things easier for us: we’ll save these Pokémon one at a time!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Great work saving Apex Shadow Ho-Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! It looks like it knows Sacred Fire, Ho-Oh’s signature move—yet this one’s Sacred Fire is somehow even more powerful!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: I wonder what will happen if you purify it. Will it become even stronger?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: I’m going to continue researching this incredible Pokémon. I’ll keep you posted on what I learn.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_3

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: We’re going to need all the help we can get!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: The team leaders and I will also continue our investigation into Apex Shadow Lugia’s whereabouts. I hope we’ll know more soon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Do you have everything you need, %PLAYERNAME%? Potions? Revives? Snacks?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: Saving Apex Shadow Lugia will be an even greater challenge, so be prepared.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: The team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has hidden Apex Shadow Lugia away in a secret hideout, guarded by a gauntlet of Grunts—and standing with them is none other than Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: And while I have you, remember how I said I’d conduct more research into Apex Shadow Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Well, it turns out that if you purify it, its Sacred Fire move will become immeasurably powerful.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Apex Purified Ho-Oh might be an incredible ally in our quest to save Apex Shadow Lugia.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_2_6
TEXT: These may just be some of the toughest battles you’ll face as a Pokémon Trainer yet. But I know you, above all else, are the one most prepared for the challenge.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_0

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: You did it!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: You saved Apex Shadow Lugia from Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Just like Ho-Oh, Apex Shadow Lugia’s Aeroblast attack is more powerful than any I’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_5
TEXT: And just like Apex Shadow Ho-Oh, I’m confident that its power will increase even more if you purify it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_6
TEXT: Now, I’d say we’re overdue for a celebration! You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_7
TEXT: Your recent accomplishments are no small feat!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_lugiahoohs_dialogue_3_8
TEXT: Thanks again for all your help. I’m sure Lugia and Ho-Oh are grateful, too. Until our next adventure...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to have you aboard this expedition. Say, have you ever heard this particular tune?

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: Da da da doo, da dee da dum... That’s what I hear in my head when I think of a certain sailor and his Wingull that I met while traveling through the Hoenn region in my younger years.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: I believe the tune was originally a sea shanty. Sailors would sing songs like this together on their seafaring adventures to keep morale high and help find a rhythm during certain tasks.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: I’m no sailor, but I do find myself feeling luckier after humming it! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: Anyway, we’re here to look into the strange situation we uncovered during your Kanto-themed journey.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: I’m talking, of course, about reports of encounters with Mew, the New Species Pokémon. There have been several sightings of a Shiny one recently, which is tremendously exciting!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_6
TEXT: That means our goal on this expedition is to find not only one of the most elusive Pokémon to ever exist, but a Shiny one at that!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_7
TEXT: You’ve experienced a lot on your journeys thus far, %PLAYERNAME%. But perhaps the most wonderful thing about Pokémon is that there’s always something new to discover.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_8
TEXT: I hope you’re excited for what’s to come, because I have a feeling it’s going to be a real test of your skills as a Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_1_9
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%—great work! Your knowledge of the Kanto region is beginning to rival even my own!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: Our next task is to learn more about Pokémon DNA.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I know that sounds pretty heavy on the science, but don’t worry—I’ll take care of that part. All I need you to do is get out there and catch lots of different types of Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: Mew’s DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so to better understand Mew, we should try to understand as much as we can about the genetics of other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing you learn so much about different Pokémon reminded me of how vast the world of Pokémon truly is.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Knowledge is funny in that the more we gain, the more realize how much we still lack. Some might find that frustrating, but for me it’s inspiring!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: You know, there’s a part in that sea shanty I mentioned before that seems applicable here.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: I don’t remember the exact words, but the gist is that we should travel across the land, searching far and wide to learn about all the amazing Pokémon there are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: Words to live by, I say! Let’s get out there and track down that Shiny Mew, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you... You did it! You actually found and caught a Shiny Mew!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: Has it even sunk in yet? This is a monumental achievement, Trainer. Take a moment to congratulate yourself!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: Hm? It’s my achievement as well? Haha! No, no, I just hummed you a shanty and guided you like any Pokémon Professor worth their sea salt would.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: But thanks are certainly in order for the Pokémon you’ve befriended on your journey. They played a big part in your research, after all!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: The ones you’ve caught, the ones you’ve battled with, and the ones that traveled with you as your buddy—each Pokémon played a critical part in helping you achieve this goal.

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: As Trainers, we owe an eternal debt to our Pokémon. After all, we can’t very well be Trainers without them!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: A Trainer’s journey is meant to be filled with amazing memories, ambitious dreams, and unexpected adventures. I think this particular journey checked all those boxes pretty handily!

RESOURCE ID: masterwork_sm_dialogue_4_7

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page1_body
TEXT: • You can now Mega Evolve a Pokémon without using Mega Energy.
• You can still use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve a Pokémon during its rest period.
• New bonuses have been added that will improve the more your Pokémon’s Mega Level increases.

After a Pokémon Mega Evolves, you’ll need to wait a while before it can Mega Evolve again without using Mega Energy. You can also use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your Pokémon before then.

TEXT: Mega Evolution Features

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page2_body
TEXT: <b>Using Mega Energy</b>
You can always Mega Evolve a Pokémon using Mega Energy even if the Pokémon is in a rest period. The Mega Energy required to do so will depend on the length of the rest period.

 <b>Rest</b>
Your Pokémon will need to rest after Mega Evolving without using Mega Energy. A Pokémon’s rest periods will become shorter the more it Mega Evolves.

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page2_title
TEXT: Two Ways to Mega Evolve

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page3_body
TEXT: Mega Energy is unique to each Pokémon species and can be earned using the following methods.
• Win Mega Raids.
• Complete certain research tasks.
• Adventure with a Buddy Pokémon that can Mega Evolve.

TEXT: Mega Energy

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page4_body
TEXT: After Mega Evolving, your Pokémon will be fatigued and need time before it can Mega Evolve again without using Mega Energy. You can always Mega Evolve a Pokémon using Mega Energy, even during a rest period.
• A Pokémon’s rest periods will become shorter the more it Mega Evolves.
• The Mega Energy required to Mega Evolve a Pokémon will decrease as the Pokémon’s rest period becomes shorter.

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page4_title
TEXT: Rest Periods

RESOURCE ID: mega_level_tutorial_page5_body
TEXT: Each Mega-Evolved Pokémon has a Mega Level. When a Pokémon’s Mega Level increases, you’ll get more bonuses, and the period you’ll have to wait before you can Mega Evolve the Pokémon again will be shorter. Each time you Mega Evolve a Pokémon, you work toward increasing its Mega Level.

TEXT: --

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0001
TEXT: Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0002
TEXT: There is a bud on this Pokémon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0003
TEXT: There is a large flower on Venusaur's back. The flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0004
TEXT: The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself. If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0005
TEXT: Charmeleon mercilessly destroys its foes using its sharp claws. If it encounters a strong foe, it turns aggressive. In this excited state, the flame at the tip of its tail flares with a bluish white color.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0006
TEXT: Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0007
TEXT: Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0008
TEXT: Its tail is large and covered with a rich, thick fur. The tail becomes increasingly deeper in color as Wartortle ages. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pokémon's toughness as a battler.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0009
TEXT: Blastoise has water spouts that protrude from its shell. The water spouts are very accurate. They can shoot bullets of water with enough accuracy to strike empty cans from a distance of over 160 feet.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0010
TEXT: Caterpie has a voracious appetite. It can devour leaves bigger than its body right before your eyes. From its antenna, this Pokémon releases a terrifically strong odor.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0011
TEXT: The shell covering this Pokémon's body is as hard as an iron slab. Metapod does not move very much. It stays still because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the hard shell.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0012
TEXT: Butterfree has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can even search out, extract, and carry honey from flowers that are blooming over six miles from its nest.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0013
TEXT: Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It is capable of distinguishing its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes just by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose).

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0014
TEXT: Kakuna remains virtually immobile as it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it is extremely busy as it prepares for its coming evolution. This is evident from how hot the shell becomes to the touch.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0015
TEXT: Beedrill is extremely territorial. No one should ever approach its nest—this is for their own safety. If angered, they will attack in a furious swarm.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0016
TEXT: Pidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It is capable of unerringly returning home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0017
TEXT: Pidgeotto claims a large area as its own territory. This Pokémon flies around, patrolling its living space. If its territory is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0018
TEXT: This Pokémon has a dazzling plumage of beautifully glossy feathers. Many Trainers are captivated by the striking beauty of the feathers on its head, compelling them to choose Pidgeot as their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0019
TEXT: Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly listens by moving its ears around. It is not picky about where it lives—it will make its nest anywhere.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0019_0046
TEXT: Night after night, they sneak into people's homes seeking food. A massive outbreak of them has become an issue of public concern.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0020
TEXT: Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0020_0048
TEXT: It commands a nest of Rattata. Different nests don't get along, whipping up severe fights over feeding grounds.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0021
TEXT: Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0022
TEXT: Fearow is recognized by its long neck and elongated beak. They are conveniently shaped for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves its long and skinny beak to pluck prey.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0023
TEXT: Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare from its upraised head.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0024
TEXT: This Pokémon is terrifically strong in order to constrict things with its body. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once Arbok wraps its body around its foe, escaping its crushing embrace is impossible.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0025
TEXT: Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokémon mistook the intensity of its charge.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0026
TEXT: If the electrical sacs become excessively charged, Raichu plants its tail in the ground and discharges. Scorched patches of ground will be found near this Pokémon's nest.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0026_0050
TEXT: When you rub its cheeks, a sweet fragrance comes wafting out. However, you'll also get a light shock!

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0027
TEXT: Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0027_0052
TEXT: The skin on its back is as hard as steel. Predators go after its soft belly, so it clings to the ground desperately.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0028
TEXT: Sandslash's body is covered by tough spikes, which are hardened sections of its hide. Once a year, the old spikes fall out, to be replaced with new spikes that grow out from beneath the old ones.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0028_0054
TEXT: A long, long time ago, it lived in the desert. With its sharp claws fully extended, it can climb right up an iceberg without slipping.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0029
TEXT: Nidoran♀ has barbs that secrete a powerful poison. They are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pokémon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0030
TEXT: When Nidorina are with their friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. This Pokémon appears to become nervous if separated from the others.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0031
TEXT: Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0032
TEXT: Nidoran♂ has developed muscles for moving its ears. Thanks to them, the ears can be freely moved in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pokémon's notice.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0033
TEXT: Nidorino has a horn that is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0034
TEXT: Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power. With one swing, it can topple a metal transmission tower. Once this Pokémon goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0035
TEXT: On every night of a full moon, groups of this Pokémon come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy return to their quiet mountain retreats and go to sleep nestled up against each other.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0036
TEXT: Clefable moves by skipping lightly as if it were flying using its wings. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. It is known to take strolls on lakes on quiet, moonlit nights.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0037
TEXT: At the time of its birth, Vulpix has one white tail. The tail separates into six if this Pokémon receives plenty of love from its Trainer. The six tails become magnificently curled.

RESOURCE ID: pokemon_desc_0037_0056

We provide real-world augmented reality platforms, designed to enable you to interact in shared worlds, seamlessly blended with the real world. To do that, we need information about you. Protecting your privacy is really important to us. We only use your information where we have a legal basis to do so. This Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have when you play any of our games, use our websites, buy merchandise from us, or take part in live events and promotions (the "Services").<br><br>Please note that in additional to the general information below, specific information about how certain of our Services use your information is provided at the end of this Privacy Policy in the “Game Specific Disclosures”.<br><br>You should also read our Terms of Service which set out the contract between you and Niantic.<br><br>Who decides how your information is used?<br><br>Niantic, Inc., is the data controller responsible for making decisions about how we use your personal information.

We collect and use that information in order to authenticate you when you register an account and use the Services, to make sure you are eligible and able to receive the Services, and so that you receive the correct version of the Services. That information includes the in-game username you choose to use on our Services, and internal account IDs that we assign to your account.<br><br>You must have an account with a supported third party single sign-on service to use our Services.

Your Personal Data will very likely be transferred and stored in a country outside of your home country, including in the USA, for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The data protection laws in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.<br><br>If we transfer your Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to other countries, including the USA, we ensure that a similar degree of protection is provided to your Personal Data as within the EEA by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:<br><br>The country that your Personal Data is transferred to is a country that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for Personal Data as the EEA.<br><br>We use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give Personal Data the same protection as it has in Europe when we engage with service providers.<br><br>Where we engage with service providers in the USA, they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide the same protection of your Personal Data as it has in the EEA.<br><br>How we keep your Personal Data safe<br><br>We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, improperly altered or disclosed. We also limit access to your Personal Data to employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.<br><br>How long we will keep your Personal Data<br><br>We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need to provide the Services to you and fulfil the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

You can also submit a customer support request through our support website here (https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=232387) for Pokémon GO, or here (https://support.ingress.com/hc/articles/206618198) for Ingress.<br><br>Object to us processing your Personal Data.

Where you cannot exercise one of these rights due to such an exception, we will explain to you why.<br><br>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the Personal Data that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.<br><br>We aim to provide the information or complete the outcome you request within 30 days.<br><br>Children<br><br>As a general rule, if you are outside the EEA, children under 13 are not allowed to use the Services. If you are based in the EEA you may only use the Services if you are over 16, or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data in your country of residence. We do however allow children to use the Pokémon GO Service, provided we have the required parental consent. For more details please read the Game-Specific Disclosures at the end of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>If we learn that we have collected Personal Data of a child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data, and we do not have parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.<br><br>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br><br>Any Personal Data that we collect is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.

We’re not responsible for the content, privacy, or security practices and policies of any Third Party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Service that you access.<br><br>11. Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pokémon GO<br><br>Pokémon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pokémon GO using your third-party Pokémon Trainer Club (“PTC”) account administered by The Pokémon Company International (“TPCI”). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the “Accounts with Children” paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pokémon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (“Parent”) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (“Child”), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child’s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child’s access to and use of Pokémon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child’s registration on Pokémon GO and prevent the Child’s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child’s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child’s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pokémon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child’s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pokémon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the “Health App Data”).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pokémon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get “credit” in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pokémon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pokémon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>

TEXT: You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. While searching for clues to your professor’s whereabouts, I uncovered an odd device among his belongings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_1
TEXT: This contraption appears similar to your Incense, but the color and scent are distinctive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_2
TEXT: You have not seen this before either? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps it is an entirely new invention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_4
TEXT: Affixed to it were several notes, though I have not read them all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_5
TEXT: If you take the device, then I will examine what is written.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part1_0_6
TEXT: Please give me some moments.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_0
TEXT: The notes were indeed enlightening, Pokémon Trainer. Your professor calls this device “Daily Adventure Incense.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_1
TEXT: Upon activation, it will attract Pokémon to your location for 15 minutes—so long as you are moving.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_part2_0_2
TEXT: The professor has arranged that one be made available to you each day. His writings indicate a sincere hope that this invention will facilitate new friendships and adventures.

TEXT: You can activate this unique Incense while you’re out and about to attract a slightly different variety of Pokémon than what you might expect to encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_2
TEXT: It only lasts for 15 minutes, but don’t worry—I’ll make sure to fix you up with a new one each day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_3
TEXT: Daily Adventure Incense works best when you’re actively moving, so it’s best not to use it while you’re taking a break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_0_4
TEXT: Excited? Me too! Now let’s give it a whirl, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_0
TEXT: I see you’ve made some new Pokémon friends already, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s have a look!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_1
TEXT: Hm...

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_2
TEXT: Very interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_3
TEXT: Some of these Pokémon aren’t usually seen around here. Pretty neat, huh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_4
TEXT: Thanks for trying out Daily Adventure Incense. Who knows—if you keep using it, you might end up seeing something legendary!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_dai_willow_part2_1_5
TEXT: Take care, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. I always run into you when I find something exciting. Maybe you’re my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_1
TEXT: Last night, I was studying the chemical reaction that causes Trubbish to appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_2
TEXT: Suddenly I saw bright flashing lights in the near distance and went to investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_3
TEXT: When I arrived at the site, I noticed a lot of damage to the ground and the surrounding area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_4
TEXT: At first, the damage looked to be caused by Trainers practicing for the GO Battle League, but my gut told me to investigate further in the morning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_0_5
TEXT: While I look into this, can you help me research Normal-type Pokémon? Some of the damage looks like it was caused by a Normal-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_0
TEXT: Thanks for getting that baseline research taken care of for me, %PLAYERNAME%. I have some updates to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_1
TEXT: After I returned to the site we’re studying, I realized there was actually a trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_2
TEXT: When I followed that trail, I started finding areas that were clearly burned.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_3
TEXT: That damage must have been done by a Fire-type Pokémon—or at least a Pokémon that knows Fire-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_4
TEXT: You know what this means, Trainer! Time to research Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_5
TEXT: The more information we have about this type of Pokémon, the more clues we’ll have to determine whatever did all this damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_1_6
TEXT: Meanwhile, I’ll continue following the trail of damage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You’re on fire?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1
TEXT: Anyway...the damage can’t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2
TEXT: Could it really have been caused by Pokémon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pokémon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3
TEXT: As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn’t seem to line up with any Pokémon I’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’m so glad you’re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1
TEXT: I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2
TEXT: She shared some notes about a Mythical Pokémon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3
TEXT: Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pokémon is Bug and Steel type, it’s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4
TEXT: This lines up with the damage at the site we’ve been researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5
TEXT: One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6
TEXT: I’ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pokémon to help us get to the bottom of this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1
TEXT: With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we’ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pokémon Genesect!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3
TEXT: Apparently, when this Pokémon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pokémon’s holding.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4
TEXT: I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5
TEXT: I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pokémon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6
TEXT: You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I’ve come across something...groundbreaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1
TEXT: I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2
TEXT: At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3
TEXT: These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pokémon in particular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4
TEXT: Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pokémon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0
TEXT: Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1
TEXT: This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pokémon. I wonder if we’ll find another Pokémon that will help us solve this puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2
TEXT: I have one in mind, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we’ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0
TEXT: As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1
TEXT: I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pokémon. It’s said that it made Pokémon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2
TEXT: Could it be these Pokémon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3
TEXT: If the first two Pokémon were Regirock and Regice...then there’s only one left that we must research further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work. I believe we’re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1
TEXT: We’re close to coming across the Legendary Pokémon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pokémon towed continents with rope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2
TEXT: Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3
TEXT: Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you’ll make a colossal discovery of your own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0
TEXT: Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1
TEXT: I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I’ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pokémon deep in slumber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2
TEXT: We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3
TEXT: Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I’ll see if I can find anything about this Pokémon in any of my texts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure the resources you’ve earned will be crucial.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1
TEXT: I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pokémon that grants wishes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2
TEXT: I’m still researching the best way to awaken this Pokémon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pokémon in the area showing signs of distress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3
TEXT: Could I ask you to investigate these reports?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1
TEXT: Many of the Pokémon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2
TEXT: I’d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I’m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3
TEXT: As you return the Pokémon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pokémon in their habitats?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1
TEXT: Apparently there’s an unusual phenomenon where Pokémon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I’ve heard Spark refer to it as a “photobomb.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2
TEXT: I’m eternally amused—and amazed—by the things we learn about Pokémon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3
TEXT: These Pokémon all seem to have something in common—music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4
TEXT: What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0
TEXT: That’s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pokémon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1
TEXT: The ancient text was right—this Mythical Pokémon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be—I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3
TEXT: It isn’t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pokémon in such diverse habitats—not to mention meeting a Mythical Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4
TEXT: I’m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I’ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0
TEXT: Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m excited to get started on our next big adventure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1
TEXT: What do we need to do? Well, I’ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_2
TEXT: We’re going to focus our efforts on Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pokémon I’ve never seen before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3
TEXT: First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_4
TEXT: Can you explore the area? Who knows—you might make some friends along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_0
TEXT: Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pokémon. I can’t wait to show you what I’ve been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1
TEXT: A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_2
TEXT: It mentions a Mythical Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_3
TEXT: I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pokémon from the Hoenn region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pokédex is really looking great!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_1
TEXT: The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_2
TEXT: That gives me an idea... Let’s do a little experiment. There’s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn’t left my lab in months. And it’s right in front of my Berry stash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_3
TEXT: Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let’s document the Whismur Evolution line, too—some photos will do.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_0
TEXT: Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1
TEXT: I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we’ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2
TEXT: If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pokémon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_3
TEXT: The text says that the Pokémon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pokémon with similar characteristics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_4
TEXT: We’ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0
TEXT: Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I’ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1
TEXT: It says that when the Mythical Pokémon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2
TEXT: Another interesting tidbit: If this Pokémon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_3
TEXT: If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_0
TEXT: It worked! I’m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we’re on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_1
TEXT: Maybe the Mythical Pokémon is close to awakening. Since what we’re doing is working, let’s keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_2
TEXT: We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_3
TEXT: I’ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_4
TEXT: If you can do that, I think it’ll help the Mythical Pokémon see that you’re a worthy Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_0
TEXT: Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pokémon Jirachi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_1
TEXT: That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_2
TEXT: You’ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_3
TEXT: You can bet I’ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let’s get out there and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_0
TEXT: How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_1
TEXT: Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pokémon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pokémon originally discovered in Unova.

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_2
TEXT: I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!

RESOURCE ID: quest_dialogue_thanks_3
TEXT: And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let’s get up and GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was hoping to see. Have you been enjoying the festival?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: I was just out on a stroll and witnessed the most incredible sight. Several rings had appeared in the sky, and as I stared up at them, something truly remarkable occurred.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_2
TEXT: Legendary Pokémon began emerging from the rings as if by magic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_3
TEXT: Naturally, I rushed back to my laboratory and began frantically searching through every book I thought might shed some light on what had happened—but I’ve yet to find anything.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_4
TEXT: I’m going to keep looking, but in the meantime, I could really use your help investigating in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_1_5
TEXT: We have to find out what’s going on here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for collecting that information, Trainer. I’m going to send it over to Blanche for analysis. Unfortunately, the rings in the sky have yet to disappear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: I did have some luck in my search for an explanation, however. Look here—it’s the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa enjoys sending things to faraway places using its rings, which can warp space.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_3
TEXT: That explains why those Legendary Pokémon appeared the way they did. Hoopa uses those rings to move things from place to place—including itself. It won’t be easy to catch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_4
TEXT: Based on reports from the team leaders, it doesn’t seem like Hoopa is in the area at the moment. Let’s use this time to prepare to catch it, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_5
TEXT: Mischievous though Hoopa may be, you have to admit that its rings are quite fascinating, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_6
TEXT: Moments like this remind me of why I became a Pokémon Professor in the first place. The world of Pokémon is endlessly exciting!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest2021_raid_dialogue_2_7
TEXT: For now, why don’t you go challenge some raids with other Trainers and catch some Pokémon? You’ll need your skills at their sharpest to catch Hoopa. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_energetic_9_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_0_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_0
TEXT: The theme of this year’s Pokémon GO Fest is music, so let’s try our best to put on a good show! The team leaders are hard at work setting up a top-class stage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_1
TEXT: With a director like you, I know we’re in for a performance we won’t soon forget.

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_3
TEXT: It’s got makeup and wardrobe standing by to help tailor its look to match your vision for the festival. Do you think you’d rather put on a rock show or a pop show?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_intro_1_4
TEXT: Pikachu’s ready to dazzle either way, so it’s really up to you! For now, I’d suggest you go for a stroll and give your decision some thought. Maybe you could pick a genre that matches one of your favorite songs?

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarponyta_5_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarzigzagoon_4_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_gofest_2021_dialogue_popstarzigzagoon_4_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_11

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_2
TEXT: Er...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_4
TEXT: Oh, thank goodness. I’ve had the most befuddling day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_5
TEXT: The Pokémon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why—but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_6
TEXT: The next thing I knew, “you” had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pokémon I’ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_7
TEXT: Hm? You noticed it too, did you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_8
TEXT: And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_9
TEXT: As you’ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn’t it lovely out?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_1
TEXT: There are Litten lying in the sun, Rowlet relaxing in the trees, Popplio playing in the water—and these malasadas Spark dropped off sure are delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_2
TEXT: It seems even the flowers smell sweeter today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_3
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see what Pokémon are around, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe we’ll find something new to research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll sit this one out. Taking breaks is important!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back already, %PLAYERNAME%—and with some new Pokémon in tow! Well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_1
TEXT: While you were gone, I noticed there’s something sparkling in the air today. Perhaps it’s a result of my radiant personality, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_2
TEXT: Haha! Seriously though, it’s something I’m looking into.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_3
TEXT: For now, let’s have a look at the Pokémon you’ve caught.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_4
TEXT: Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pokémon that are often found on Alola’s Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_5
TEXT: Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_6
TEXT: There’s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park—which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_7
TEXT: How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pokémon while you’re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pokémon often seen about Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s quite an assortment of Pokémon you’ve encountered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_1
TEXT: I wish I’d been out there with you, but I wasn’t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_2
TEXT: You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pokémon behind a flower bush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_3
TEXT: Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_4
TEXT: The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele’s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_5
TEXT: Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let’s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_0
TEXT: Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_1
TEXT: I wasn’t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I’ve been seeing in the air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_2
TEXT: They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_3
TEXT: How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_4
TEXT: *gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_5
TEXT: So, we’ve been visited by two of Alola’s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_6
TEXT: Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we’re staying on its good side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_7
TEXT: If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they’re appearing...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_8
TEXT: But that’s for me to ponder. Don’t trouble yourself with it—go out and enjoy the day! I’ll be in touch soon. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1
TEXT: You may know this already, but some Pokémon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks—so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2
TEXT: Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3
TEXT: You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4
TEXT: I’d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, “lucky” enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1
TEXT: When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler’s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pokémon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2
TEXT: Oh! And this fact’s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the “fireworks of the earth”!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3
TEXT: You know, I’d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0
TEXT: Well done! That’s a mighty Alolan Graveler you’ve got there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1
TEXT: I’d love to see those “fireworks of the earth” for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2
TEXT: In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing—an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3
TEXT: I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can’t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it’s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4
TEXT: Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0
TEXT: Ah, you’re back—and with an Alolan Golem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1
TEXT: Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2
TEXT: Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we’d best be careful around Alolan Golem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3
TEXT: You have an incredible knack for befriending Pokémon, though, so I’m sure you’ll be the best of pals in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always “rocks” to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1
TEXT: Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra’s ability to teleport.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2
TEXT: When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it’s made copies of itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3
TEXT: However, what’s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let’s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1
TEXT: It’s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2
TEXT: Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3
TEXT: I’ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I’ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0
TEXT: I’m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I’m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1
TEXT: While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it’s sleeping! What amazing abilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2
TEXT: Why don’t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I’ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I’ve developed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3
TEXT: While it won’t give you Abra’s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0
TEXT: Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1
TEXT: We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pokémon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2
TEXT: Pokémon are truly amazing creatures. There’s always something to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_at_3_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_battle_weekend_1_0
TEXT: Where will you focus your efforts, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pokémon, and I think you’re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: Let’s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pokémon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it’s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you’d pick Bidoof. Don’t ask me how!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata’s teeth, Bidoof’s teeth are continually growing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you’d pick the Plump Mouse Pokémon. Don’t ask me why!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pokémon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors—a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pokémon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_1
TEXT: Now—according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pokémon that has nerves of steel or a Pokémon that nests alongside water.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_2
TEXT: I know what you’re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn’t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: You’re going with Bidoof, huh? I like your style, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Bidoof isn’t just cute to look at—it’s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: You choose Bidoof, eh? I never doubted it for a second.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof’s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow its banks, which is appreciated by people nearby. Fascinating, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pokémon—especially Bidoof!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: Why don’t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around—have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1
TEXT: Personally, I’ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pokémon they could find.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2
TEXT: In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3
TEXT: It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there’s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pokémon, no matter the species.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4
TEXT: In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. That’s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you’ve caught!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2
TEXT: I’d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that’s for sure! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Bulbasaur’s Evolution—Ivysaur—gains strength when it’s exposed to sunlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4
TEXT: That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time’s sake.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5
TEXT: While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I’ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I’ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0
TEXT: Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1
TEXT: If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur’s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower’s about to bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2
TEXT: Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3
TEXT: Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4
TEXT: They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what’s their destination, I wonder? Let’s go see if we can’t dig up some answers, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on—is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1
TEXT: You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pokémon that had gathered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pokémon, so I surmised that’s what was occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3
TEXT: In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pokémon via scent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4
TEXT: Now, let’s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5
TEXT: Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You’ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur’s power for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_6
TEXT: There are so many things we can learn from Pokémon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today’s scientific excursion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_1
TEXT: I have a feeling that there’s so much more about this world that we’ve yet to discover, and I’m glad I can count on you to see it through.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I’m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pokémon that’s rarely seen.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_0
TEXT: Wow, you and your Pokémon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pokémon I’m tracking only appears in times of peace.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_1
TEXT: Also, from what I’ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_2
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we’re getting closer to this Mythical Pokémon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_1
TEXT: Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you’ve earned to good use as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_2
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that this Pokémon’s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_2
TEXT: I’ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you’ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon—a Psychic-type Pokémon just like the Mythical Pokémon I’m researching!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_3
TEXT: Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_0
TEXT: Oh wow, is that an Eevee you’ve caught? Perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_1
TEXT: Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I’m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind—like we’ve been here before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_2
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you’ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_3
TEXT: I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn’t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pokémon we’re researching has the ability to travel across time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_1
TEXT: Maybe that’s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pokémon is nearby?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_2
TEXT: I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_3
TEXT: While you’re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_4
TEXT: Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_0
TEXT: This data is so helpful. Thank you! I’ll use it to explore my theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_1
TEXT: While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pokémon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_2
TEXT: I think if you catch more Grass-type Pokémon, this elusive time-traveling Pokémon will reveal itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_3
TEXT: Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pokémon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_1
TEXT: You’ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you’re inspiring me to discover even more Pokémon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1
TEXT: In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pokémon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2
TEXT: Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3
TEXT: Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn’t the first time I’ve witnessed such a gathering...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4
TEXT: Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2
TEXT: For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pokémon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3
TEXT: Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4
TEXT: Charmander’s evolved form is Charmeleon—but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0
TEXT: That’s a fine Charmeleon you’ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1
TEXT: Known as the Flame Pokémon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2
TEXT: When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3
TEXT: The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4
TEXT: Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pokémon! Come back and see me once you’ve evolved your Charmeleon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pokémon Charizard!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1
TEXT: Charizard is a truly amazing Pokémon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2
TEXT: While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3
TEXT: What a superb display of control! It’s amazing to see how this Pokémon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4
TEXT: They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0
TEXT: I can see you’re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pokémon? That’s right—I’m talking about Mega Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1
TEXT: Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pokémon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2
TEXT: Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3
TEXT: It’s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4
TEXT: Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet’s.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5
TEXT: Simply amazing! I can’t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6
TEXT: Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I just developed this new type of Incense—Daily Adventure Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_1
TEXT: One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you’re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pokémon you’ve encountered before—even Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_2
TEXT: I’ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don’t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pokémon as you can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve come to the end of the year once again...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_1
TEXT: And it looks like some familiar Pokémon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_2
TEXT: Do you think they’re here to celebrate the year’s end with us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_3
TEXT: I hope you’ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you’ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_4
TEXT: We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pokémon you’ve caught! Up for another challenge?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_1
TEXT: Will you evolve a few of them for me? I’d say you’ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_2
TEXT: What mischief it made this year—remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_3
TEXT: The bond between Trainer and Pokémon can change so much more than just a Pokémon’s appearance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_4
TEXT: Just something to think about as you evolve your Pokémon today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_0
TEXT: With a new year just around the corner, I can’t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pokémon, and our fellow Trainers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_1
TEXT: That reminds me—have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we’re in for quite an adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_2
TEXT: I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past—and our shared future...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_3
TEXT: Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pokémon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Poké Ball throws, too. Let’s end the year awash in new knowledge!

TEXT: You’ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here’s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you’ve done for me this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_1
TEXT: I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_1
TEXT: It’s almost as if Pokémon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_2
TEXT: Strangely enough, the Pokémon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_3
TEXT: Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We’ve had quite a year, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_4
TEXT: As you venture out to catch these Pokémon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you’ve grown as a Pokémon Trainer along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_5
TEXT: Who knows—you might even surprise yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_0
TEXT: Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_1
TEXT: As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we’ve accomplished together this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_2
TEXT: We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_3
TEXT: We even encountered Legendary Pokémon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_4
TEXT: Then there were the Pokémon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch’d!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_5
TEXT: Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_6
TEXT: Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve rambled on long enough. It’s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_0
TEXT: Ah—Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_1
TEXT: Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_2
TEXT: OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry—I couldn’t help it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_3
TEXT: You know, Gastly isn’t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_4
TEXT: That’s right—I’m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_5
TEXT: You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren’t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_6
TEXT: I hope that world comes to be someday.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_7
TEXT: Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_8
TEXT: Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_0
TEXT: It’s certainly been an interesting year, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can’t remember another one like it, and I’ve seen a few!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_1
TEXT: But despite all the ways it’s challenged us, I can’t help but think that it’ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_2
TEXT: After all, no matter what happens, we’re all on this Pokémon journey together—every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_3
TEXT: That’s truly something special.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_4
TEXT: So when the going gets tough, remember that you’re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_5
TEXT: I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_6
TEXT: The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn’t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_7
TEXT: And as the mysterious world of Pokémon continues to grow, so do we—as Trainers, as a community, and as people.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_8
TEXT: So here’s to a year for the books—and many more exciting ones to come!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_0
TEXT: It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_1
TEXT: Ah! Greetings again, Pokémon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pokémon are present today—Deino, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_2
TEXT: Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand—but do not fret. The pain was minimal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_3
TEXT: This world is replete with unique Pokémon. Though I wish to study them all, today’s focus will be on Deino alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_4
TEXT: May I borrow some moments from you, Pokémon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_1
TEXT: Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_2
TEXT: ......

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_3
TEXT: Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_4
TEXT: I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pokémon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_5
TEXT: I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_0
TEXT: How dee, Pokémon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah—stickers. What is the function of these adornments?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_1
TEXT: I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pokémon Trainers in this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_2
TEXT: Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pokémon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_3
TEXT: Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pokémon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_4
TEXT: If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino’s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_0
TEXT: Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_1
TEXT: I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous—though I cannot discern if either head can see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_2
TEXT: The two heads appear quite quarrelsome—particularly regarding food. Ah—be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_3
TEXT: Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_4
TEXT: I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pokémon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_5
TEXT: Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_6
TEXT: I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here—but the Pokémon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%, great timing! Fancy doing a little investigation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_1
TEXT: All these Ultra Wormholes we’ve encountered lately have got me thinking. Ultra Space is fascinating, sure, but there are places closer to home that still beg to be explored—like the fabled island of Dragonite!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_2
TEXT: Have you heard the tale?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_3
TEXT: Once, a Dragonite saved a shipwrecked man, taking him to a remote island—a paradise occupied solely by Dragonite. Doesn’t that sound like something, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_4
TEXT: Imagine the unique ecosystem that island would have! It’d be a veritable treasure trove for scientific inquiry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_5
TEXT: Questions are already rattling around in my head: what do Dragonite use their horns for? How quickly can they move in water? What kind of Berries do they—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_6
TEXT: Whoops. I’m getting ahead of myself. First, we need to do some baseline research on the Pokémon in question.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_7
TEXT: We might even find some clues about this Dragonite paradise! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_8
TEXT: Let’s start by observing Dratini, which can evolve into Dragonair and then Dragonite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_0
TEXT: Whoa! Look at how many Dratini you’ve caught, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that in the past, Dratini was so rarely glimpsed that some called it the “Mirage Pokémon”?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_2
TEXT: And yet here you are with a whole host of them. They seem real enough to me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_3
TEXT: You know, I read a report recently that a small colony of Dratini was found living underwater.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_4
TEXT: That would suggest that Dratini and its Evolutions like to live in groups.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_5
TEXT: And if that’s true...then the island of Dragonite could be real after all! First, though, we should learn more about Dratini’s Evolution, Dragonair.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_6
TEXT: Think you can find one, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_0
TEXT: What a majestic Dragonair, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_1
TEXT: Dragonair’s mystical appearance always leaves me in awe. In fact, this Pokémon is known for its gentle aura.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_2
TEXT: Some even call it divine! And for good reason—see the crystalline globes on its head and tail? Dragonair can use them to freely control the weather.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_3
TEXT: I bet that’d come in useful if you had, say, an island full of Dragonite that you wanted to keep hidden. Or if you were constantly forgetting your research notes outside on rainy days...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_4
TEXT: But that’s a me problem. Next, let’s help Dragonair evolve into the star of today’s studies—Dragonite!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_1
TEXT: Just like Dratini and Dragonair, Dragonite is an extremely rarely seen Pokémon. How lucky we are that we can study one today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_2
TEXT: Dragonite is known as “the sea incarnate.” Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it’s satisfied.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_3
TEXT: Luckily for us, it’s typically a kindhearted Pokémon. If it spots a drowning person or Pokémon, Dragonite simply must help them—like that shipwrecked man I mentioned earlier today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_4
TEXT: Why don’t we set sail and get looking for that island? Dragonite’ll surely bail us out if things go sideways!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_5
TEXT: I’m joking, I’m joking. Thanks for humoring me today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_6
TEXT: Even without weighing anchor, we learned more about Pokémon and found new ways to look at facts we already knew. I’d say that’s time well spent.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_7
TEXT: Though to be fair, I’d say that about any time we spend together. Heh. I’ll be in touch again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you noticed an increase in Ghost-type Pokémon appearing lately? Because I sure have.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_1
TEXT: I was conducting some research in my lab recently when I felt a chill run up my spine—almost like something was watching me from the shadows.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_2
TEXT: I whirled around to face my uninvited guest and saw a Pokémon floating eerily in the corner! Apparently startled by my gaze, it flew through the wall and escaped into the great outdoors. I haven’t seen it since.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_3
TEXT: Based on my brief glimpse of it and its quick escape, I believe my visitor was Duskull, the Requiem Pokémon. It’s known to silently sneak up on its prey by making itself invisible. It also has the ability to slip straight through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_4
TEXT: Naturally, my goal now is to learn more about Duskull. Can you lend me a hand? Hopefully we can come to understand why it was sneaking around my lab!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work researching Duskull. While you were out, I actually had another eerie encounter in my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_1
TEXT: I saw Duskull slipping through a wall to scare me again, so I shouted, “BOO!” before it could and turned the tables. It fled back through the wall—but then it reappeared and looked at me expectantly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_2
TEXT: Thus began an impromptu game of peek-a-boo! It made me realize that Duskull may not get many chances to play with others because people are so quick to startle at its appearance. Makes you a bit sad, doesn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_3
TEXT: I wonder what else we can learn about Duskull. I know: Why don’t you try evolving your Duskull into Dusclops? Also known as the Beckon Pokémon, Dusclops apparently sucks everything in as if it were a black hole—so be careful of its mouth!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_0
TEXT: Wait, %PLAYERNAME%, you did WHAT? I was so sure I told you NOT to feed a Berry to Dusclops... But maybe I said the opposite by mistake? Yeah, my bad on that one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_1
TEXT: But it just ate the Berry normally, huh? No danger of you getting sucked in as well? Fascinating... O-oh, and, er, quite relieving! Yes, glad to see you back in one piece.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_2
TEXT: Now, let’s learn more about Dusclops’s Evolution, Dusknoir. Known as the Gripper Pokémon, it’s said to steal people and Pokémon away at the behest of transmissions from the spirit world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_3
TEXT: No one knows whether Dusknoir has a will of its own. Sounds like a Pokémon ripe for researching! Could you evolve your Dusclops for me so we can learn more?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_0
TEXT: Hey there, Trai— AAAH! G-G-G-GHOST! Behind you! It’s— Wait. Is that Dusknoir? Hah, sorry about that. It’s my first time seeing one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_1
TEXT: No matter how spooky they may seem, we have to remember that Ghost-type Pokémon are Pokémon all the same. They’re looking for friends just like the rest of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_2
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope to see you and your Dusknoir again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_1
TEXT: Not sure if you’ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2
TEXT: Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution lies within Eevee’s genetics.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_3
TEXT: I can understand that hypothesis—after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_4
TEXT: I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_5
TEXT: I don’t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time—even to formal events!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, perhaps by researching Eevee, we’ll unravel even more mysteries of Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to get started! Let’s GO learn about Eevee!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0
TEXT: Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1
TEXT: According to my findings, Eevee’s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2
TEXT: For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pokémon of such different types?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4
TEXT: As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pokémon. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1
TEXT: These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2
TEXT: Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3
TEXT: Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4
TEXT: And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t it amazing that all three of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps there’s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7
TEXT: Let’s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pokémon can evolve into Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8
TEXT: If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_1
TEXT: The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies’ next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2
TEXT: As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It’s said that Umbreon’s rings glow yellow under the full moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3
TEXT: Who would’ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pokémon Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4
TEXT: It’s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5
TEXT: Let’s keep it up by researching Eevee’s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6
TEXT: The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7
TEXT: Why don’t you research these Pokémon next?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1
TEXT: I see you’ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2
TEXT: The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pokémon and an Ice-type Pokémon. It’s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pokémon can be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3
TEXT: We might not uncover all the secrets of Pokémon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4
TEXT: Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5
TEXT: I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6
TEXT: But enough of this professor’s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution—the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7
TEXT: This Pokémon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8
TEXT: I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pokémon like Sylveon sometime soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m really glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2
TEXT: It didn’t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab’s electricity would make an excellent snack.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3
TEXT: Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4
TEXT: Do you think you could catch some of these Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5
TEXT: The research would be valuable, and I’d be grateful to have my power restored!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for the assistance—I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2
TEXT: Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3
TEXT: A weak electric current flows between Elekid’s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4
TEXT: Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5
TEXT: Anyway, let’s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren’t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Electric Pokémon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2
TEXT: Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz’s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3
TEXT: Simply amazing! Let’s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what electrifying facts we’ll learn about that Evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0
TEXT: I just don’t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1
TEXT: OH! I didn’t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2
TEXT: According to the Pokédex, as Electivire’s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3
TEXT: When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4
TEXT: Be careful with this Pokémon when battling with it—that’s a lot of power you’re dealing with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5
TEXT: With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I’m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6
TEXT: Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How’s your day?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_1
TEXT: Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps…flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_2
TEXT: I heard some Pokémon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_3
TEXT: Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pokémon, and it’s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you’ll quickly see its more ferocious side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_4
TEXT: A fascinating little Pokémon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it’s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_5
TEXT: Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what’s going on?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer. Looks like you’ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Fletchling’s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pokémon in their beds. How about that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_2
TEXT: I’m always fascinated to learn about how Pokémon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pokémon Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Ember Pokémon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_5
TEXT: It’s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_6
TEXT: When you’re ready, why don’t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I’d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_0
TEXT: That’s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_1
TEXT: Naturally, I’ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_2
TEXT: You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_3
TEXT: Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft—er, drift.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_4
TEXT: Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We’re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_5
TEXT: With that said, there are still a few more tasks I’d like you to complete in aid of our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_6
TEXT: Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They’re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%—and hello, Talonflame!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_1
TEXT: I know I’ve put you through your paces today, but it’s all paid off in the end! You’re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_2
TEXT: Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_3
TEXT: Remember how I mentioned Talonflame’s wings before? Fire can’t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_4
TEXT: Amazing stuff! I’m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things—and at great speeds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1
TEXT: You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2
TEXT: A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee—spilled. Pinap Berry—squished. Day—ruined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3
TEXT: At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4
TEXT: For my sake—and my breakfast’s—can you help me research Ice-type Pokémon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We’ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pokémon, and it looks as if you’ve caught a few interesting ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1
TEXT: I feel like we’re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast’s untimely demise. Oh! There’s something I forgot to mention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2
TEXT: That very evening—after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day—I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3
TEXT: As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4
TEXT: I was simply too comfortable in bed—and too frightened—to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5
TEXT: I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pokémon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6
TEXT: Can you investigate some Pokémon related to making peculiar sounds? Let’s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0
TEXT: ... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1
TEXT: Oh, I didn’t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you’ve done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2
TEXT: Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3
TEXT: I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pokémon—Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4
TEXT: Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pokémon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5
TEXT: While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it’s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it’s not as frightening as I first thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1
TEXT: Perhaps it’ll become even more approachable when it evolves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2
TEXT: I’ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pokémon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3
TEXT: I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0
TEXT: What a fascinating Pokémon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1
TEXT: I've heard stories of Mr. Rime’s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2
TEXT: This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I’m not sure I can say I’d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1
TEXT: I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2
TEXT: Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3
TEXT: Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4
TEXT: I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pokémon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5
TEXT: I know it just wanted a nibble, but that’s a nibble too much in my book!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6
TEXT: Anyway, it’s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1
TEXT: While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pokémon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2
TEXT: I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3
TEXT: Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4
TEXT: We’ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pokémon, but there’s always more to discover!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5
TEXT: When you’re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0
TEXT: Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1
TEXT: Gabite is known as the Cave Pokémon, and it loves sparkly things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2
TEXT: It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3
TEXT: What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4
TEXT: We’ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there’s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you’ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0
TEXT: Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s an admirable Garchomp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1
TEXT: Known as the Mach Pokémon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2
TEXT: Those scales don’t just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3
TEXT: I think you’ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4
TEXT: And I can’t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1
TEXT: I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pokémon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2
TEXT: We need to figure out what’s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3
TEXT: Now that you’re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4
TEXT: First things first—could you help survey the park and get some supplies?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_5
TEXT: Please complete the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_0
TEXT: Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1
TEXT: I’m not sure what could have caused it—they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2
TEXT: Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3
TEXT: The local Pokémon have become confused… It looks like they’re acting more aggressive and territorial!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4
TEXT: Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pokémon to make the situation a bit more stable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5
TEXT: Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0
TEXT: Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pokémon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_1
TEXT: However, I'm not sure that was sufficient—the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pokémon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2
TEXT: I've been seeing some unusual Pokémon called Unown floating around the area...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3
TEXT: This Pokémon is shaped like ancient writing…and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pokémon—the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4
TEXT: Let's do the following research tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0
TEXT: Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1
TEXT: I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2
TEXT: Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3
TEXT: It's a difficult task… We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4
TEXT: The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5
TEXT: These Pokémon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6
TEXT: If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7
TEXT: Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8
TEXT: Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!
{0}
{1}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0
TEXT: That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1
TEXT: It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2
TEXT: I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4
TEXT: This weekend will be one to remember!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1
TEXT: While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pokémon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might’ve called it...a ghastly sight!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2
TEXT: Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It’s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren’t blown away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3
TEXT: However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They’re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1
TEXT: I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn’t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2
TEXT: Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it’s time for us to start looking into Gastly’s Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3
TEXT: I’ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we’ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1
TEXT: It’s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it’s just being playful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2
TEXT: I’ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don’t think Blanche is amused.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pokémon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1
TEXT: If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2
TEXT: Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3
TEXT: BOO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4
TEXT: Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pokémon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it’s a fantastic Pokémon to have on your team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I’ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_0
TEXT: OoOoOo... There’s a chill in the air... Can you feel it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_1
TEXT: Seems like I’ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pokémon we’ve been seeing somehow involved?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_2
TEXT: Either way, I think we’re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we’ll face it together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_3
TEXT: Speaking of faces, I’ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pokémon, so it seems like now’s the time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_5
TEXT: Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_0
TEXT: Ah—a Yamask AND a Duskull!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_1
TEXT: I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_2
TEXT: It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pokémon by its...well, skull, I suppose!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_3
TEXT: Now, about that Yamask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_4
TEXT: Known as the Spirit Pokémon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_5
TEXT: A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_6
TEXT: What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_7
TEXT: Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_8
TEXT: Perhaps you’ll come across one while you’re out conducting research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_9
TEXT: I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_0
TEXT: Wow, a Galarian Yamask!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_1
TEXT: Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_2
TEXT: It’s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_3
TEXT: Oh, and you’ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pokémon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_4
TEXT: I wouldn’t want to be that kid, that’s for sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_5
TEXT: Between Galarian Yamask’s slab, Banette’s puppet body, and all the Pokémon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor’s turned way up at the moment!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_6
TEXT: Even so, I’d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_7
TEXT: Come on, Trainer—let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_0
TEXT: Looks like we’re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_2
TEXT: In fact, Cubone—which evolves into Marowak—is even said to wear the skull of its mother.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_3
TEXT: When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother’s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_4
TEXT: Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we’ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven’t we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_5
TEXT: Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pokémon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won’t stop me from continuing to try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_6
TEXT: After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I’m studying Pokémon. You know what I mean?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_7
TEXT: Anyway, I think we’re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. It is fortunate you’ve arrived.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_1
TEXT: I just observed a curious sight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_2
TEXT: Floating over there were vaguely human visages, and carved slabs of...clay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_3
TEXT: Yet despite the differences between these apparitions, they had a similar air.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_4
TEXT: As with many mysterious things in this world, I suspect Pokémon to be behind this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_5
TEXT: Assuming I am correct, I wish to catch them. Then perhaps Professor Willow can share his insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_0
TEXT: Where’s that old getup of mine—oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been thinking of what to wear to Spark’s upcoming costume party. A Litwick hat? A Pikachu onesie? I can’t have Candela outshine me again this year.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_2
TEXT: Speaking of masquerades—is that a Yamask AND a Galarian Yamask? I can’t disguise my excitement!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_3
TEXT: You know, they say Yamask carry masks that used to be their faces when they were human. Sometimes they look at them and cry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_4
TEXT: And Galarian Yamask are supposedly formed when ancient clay tablets are drawn to vengeful spirits.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_5
TEXT: Somber origins, but don’t they set your curiosity ablaze? I wonder how Yamask feel now that they’ve become Pokémon. What sort of thoughts are running through their minds?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_6
TEXT: In the “spirit” of inquiry, why don’t you see what other Ghost-type Pokémon you can find? You might even come across more Yamask!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_0
TEXT: Professor Willow is certainly knowledgeable. We were right to seek his wisdom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_1
TEXT: To think that Yamask and Galarian Yamask have such origins... Incredible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_2
TEXT: I must thank you for catching them. With every day we spend together, I learn something new.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_3
TEXT: The Pokémon we’ve seen of late have been...dark, in a manner of speaking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_4
TEXT: But as the Professor said, they are simply another mystery we researchers can illuminate with our findings. Fear need not be a component of exploring the unknown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_5
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I shall continue observing these Yamask as I ponder today’s events.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_6
TEXT: Perhaps you could investigate other Ghost-type Pokémon in the meantime.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_7
TEXT: And to repay Professor Willow, I could see if I possess a GO Ultra Recon Squad uniform in his size...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. I’ve just about finished my Yamask, erm, mask, inspired by you and Rhi! What’ve the two of you been up to?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_1
TEXT: Whoa, you’ve caught even more Ghost-type Pokémon! It’s starting to look like a haunted house around here—or a haunted lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_2
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon always remind me how much remains in the world for us to uncover. Where do Drifloon drift off to? Do Duskull really spirit away bad children? What powers a Golett?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_3
TEXT: With enough time and perseverance, I’m sure we researchers will find the answers to these questions and more. Or maybe they’ll be answered by an up-and-at-’em Trainer like you! When it comes to learning, jump in headfirst, I always say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_4
TEXT: Though...maybe I should amend that motto to exclude Ultra Wormholes. Haha.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for the extra motivation today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll see you again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0
TEXT: BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1
TEXT: Hope I didn’t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2
TEXT: Say, since you’re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I’ve heard some reports of an unusual Pokémon appearing in a nearby forest.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3
TEXT: Why aren’t I going into that dark forest to find this Pokémon myself? W-well, er, it’s certainly not because I’m scared!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4
TEXT: Y-you see I would, but I’m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5
TEXT: Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it’s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6
TEXT: Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks—and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0
TEXT: Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pokémon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%— AH!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1
TEXT: What’s that sound?! Oh, it’s just a Yamask. Seems like it’s looking at its mask and crying.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2
TEXT: Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pokémon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you’re going to have to venture back out there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3
TEXT: After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pokémon, it turns out we aren’t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4
TEXT: The Yamask we’re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask’s dark power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5
TEXT: Unfortunately, I can’t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0
TEXT: Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pokémon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already— Oh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are— EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2
TEXT: I’ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you’ve encountered a Spiritomb before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3
TEXT: There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That’s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4
TEXT: One might say that it’s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb—too much?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time’s the charm, right? I’m sure you’ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6
TEXT: I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0
TEXT: Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pokémon—looks like you’re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1
TEXT: Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pokémon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2
TEXT: Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pokémon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pokémon than its counterpart from Unova does!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3
TEXT: All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I’m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pokédex!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4
TEXT: Anyway, I’m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5
TEXT: I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we’ve had, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_1
TEXT: How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_2
TEXT: I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_3
TEXT: While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_4
TEXT: I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn’t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_5
TEXT: As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_6
TEXT: There was a note attached. I’ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here’s what I’ve got so far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_7
TEXT: “Offer sweets and dust you’ve found 
So Hoopa’s form will be unbound

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_10
TEXT: Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful—but I think you can handle it, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_11
TEXT: It’s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we’ve finally reached the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_12
TEXT: It’s almost bittersweet, don’t you think? But fret not—I’m sure more discoveries await!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_13
TEXT: Let’s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries—you, me, and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_8
TEXT: Of course, this is all just a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_9
TEXT: We’ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_1
TEXT: I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You’d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_2
TEXT: I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pokémon, don’t you agree?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_3
TEXT: It’s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_4
TEXT: Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let’s see about catching a few to find out more about them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_0
TEXT: Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_1
TEXT: They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_2
TEXT: Hoppip can also evolve, and it’s quite the sight. Don’t take my word for it—how about you go see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_0
TEXT: What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_1
TEXT: The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom’s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn’t that fascinating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_2
TEXT: In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don’t blame it—if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_3
TEXT: Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don’t you evolve one, hm?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_1
TEXT: Wouldn’t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_2
TEXT: On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll—maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_3
TEXT: See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_0
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_1
TEXT: James: What is it, Jessie?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_2
TEXT: Jessie: Apparently, there’s a mysterious Pokémon in a jungle nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_3
TEXT: James: Go on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_4
TEXT: Jessie: They say it’s called the Protector of the Jungle or something like that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_5
TEXT: James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pokémon the Boss would be happy to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_6
TEXT: Jessie: It’s going to be a pain, though, since we don’t really know the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_7
TEXT: James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_8
TEXT: Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_9
TEXT: James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you’re here, let’s get to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_0
TEXT: Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can’t believe you actually did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_1
TEXT: James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around— I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_2
TEXT: Jessie: As you can imagine, it’s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we’re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_3
TEXT: James: Superb idea, Jessie! It’s important to change up the pace every once in a while!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_4
TEXT: James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_0
TEXT: Jessie: I’m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_1
TEXT: James: Now that you mention it, you haven’t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what’s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_10
TEXT: James: Hey, who exactly are you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_11
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_12
TEXT: Jessie: You’d better start talking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_13
TEXT: Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_14
TEXT: James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_15
TEXT: Jessie: You know too much! We can’t let you go! Let’s get ’em, James!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_16
TEXT: James: Don’t you dare get in our way! You’ll regret it if you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_17
TEXT: Jessie: Don’t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_18
TEXT: Jessie: Prepare for trouble...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_19
TEXT: James: And make it double!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_2
TEXT: Jessie: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_20
TEXT: Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_21
TEXT: James: To unite all people— HEY! Are you even listening?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_3
TEXT: James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_4
TEXT: James: Jessie, who actually told you that we’d be getting an assistant?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_5
TEXT: Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_6
TEXT: James: Well, no one told me, either!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_7
TEXT: Jessie: But you’re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_8
TEXT: James: I said no such thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_9
TEXT: James: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_0
TEXT: Jessie: I can’t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_1
TEXT: James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_2
TEXT: James: Huh?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_3
TEXT: Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn’t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_4
TEXT: James: Drat! That Pokémon was supposed to be ours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_5
TEXT: Jessie: Mark our words...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_6
TEXT: James: We’ll get you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_7
TEXT: Jessie: We’re blasting off again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Is it just me, or is there a ghostly chill in the air?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_1
TEXT: It could have something to do with those lights over there! They belong to Litwick, the Candle Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_2
TEXT: Litwick is known to leech off the life force of any who follow it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_3
TEXT: The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns. Makes for a pretty ominous candle, wouldn’t you say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_4
TEXT: Litwick appearing in such force makes the perfect chance to learn more about them. I suggest you get up close and see for yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_5
TEXT: Just be careful not to let Litwick lead you anywhere, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_0
TEXT: Good day, Trainer. Professor Willow has tasked you with investigating...Litwick, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_1
TEXT: The flame on its head is certainly alluring. A Pokémon that can bring light to its surroundings… What could be the source of its brilliant glow?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_2
TEXT: "Life force," Professor Willow says? Peculiar. I wonder—would those flames transform if Litwick were to evolve?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_3
TEXT: What are your thoughts, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! You went looking for Litwick and came back with a lamp! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_1
TEXT: I kid—I know a Lampent when I see one! And it was Rhi who suggested you help Litwick evolve? That’s great. We can always learn more when encouraged by our friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_2
TEXT: So, let me tell you about Lampent! While it often pretends to be a lamp, Lampent is usually feared as an emissary of death. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_3
TEXT: Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen. Spooky, but appropriate for the season! 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_4
TEXT: And what a sight that fire is. I’m sure you and Rhi would get a kick out of seeing Lampent’s Evolution, Chandelure, too! But a word of caution, %PLAYERNAME%...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_5
TEXT: They say spirits burned up in Chandelure's ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_0
TEXT: That new Pokémon...
... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_1
TEXT: Oh. My apologies, %PLAYERNAME%. I was...preoccupied gazing at the flame your Pokémon is emanating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_2
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_3
TEXT: The swaying of its arms is rather hypnotic.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_4
TEXT: It's called "Chandelure," is it? And Professor Willow said its flames can burn up spirits? An unsettling thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_5
TEXT: The Pokémon we studied today could easily be seen as frightening. Yet I believe there is a lesson we can take from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_6
TEXT: No matter how dark the world becomes, a little light always persists.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_7
TEXT: Thank you for teaching me that lesson once again, %PLAYERNAME%. Take care, and I will see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1
TEXT: You’ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2
TEXT: Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3
TEXT: And look at you now! I’m glad we can share that memory together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4
TEXT: Now, I’m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pokémon, but it’s important to keep your skills sharp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5
TEXT: How about you head out and catch some Pokémon? I’ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6
TEXT: Good luck—and have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0
TEXT: Great work as always, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1
TEXT: I’m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2
TEXT: These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve built special bonds with several Pokémon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pokémon that you like to always bring into battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4
TEXT: I’d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don’t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_5
TEXT: After all, the best Trainers never stop training!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6
TEXT: Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0
TEXT: How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1
TEXT: I’m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pokémon companions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2
TEXT: It’s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pokémon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3
TEXT: Say, why don’t you evolve some of the Pokémon you’ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4
TEXT: Enough about that, though—back to our research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5
TEXT: This next batch will test your Pokémon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That’s right—you’ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6
TEXT: Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0
TEXT: Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1
TEXT: I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pokémon you sent over. It’s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it’s caught Blanche’s eye as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2
TEXT: Anyway, I should probably get back to work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3
TEXT: But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4
TEXT: I’m truly proud of you and how much you’ve grown!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5
TEXT: I know you’re far from finished on that front, too, so I’ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6
TEXT: Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you’ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1
TEXT: As for me, I’ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pokémon lately, and it’s helped me think of some new research opportunities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2
TEXT: Do you remember your first Buddy Pokémon? I remember mine—it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pokémon Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3
TEXT: I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4
TEXT: That’s a proud moment in any Trainer’s journey, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5
TEXT: Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next PokéStop we’ll visit.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6
TEXT: Why don’t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0
TEXT: Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting PokéStops?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1
TEXT: I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2
TEXT: I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3
TEXT: Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pokémon. It’s also a wonderful form of exercise!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4
TEXT: Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pokémon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he’s cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5
TEXT: How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pokémon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6
TEXT: Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0
TEXT: Did you make any fun memories with your Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1
TEXT: I’m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2
TEXT: I’m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pokémon like Smeargle!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3
TEXT: That’s one of the best parts of taking snapshots—you never know what you’re going to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4
TEXT: Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers’ snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5
TEXT: To start, why don’t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you’re ready, I think we’ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6
TEXT: They’re always up to something, so it’s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby PokéStops. Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn’t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2
TEXT: The power of friendship is strong indeed—and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3
TEXT: The trust between a Trainer and their Pokémon is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4
TEXT: I’m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5
TEXT: I’ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_6
TEXT: Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_1
TEXT: I can see you’ve been working as hard as ever!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2
TEXT: We’ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven’t we? I think it’s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time—especially when you’ve accomplished so much!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3
TEXT: A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4
TEXT: It’s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pokémon that sealed the victory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_5
TEXT: How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m sure you’ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6
TEXT: I’d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don’t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0
TEXT: You clearly have some powerful Pokémon, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1
TEXT: You’ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2
TEXT: I’m happy to report that she’s just as proud of you as I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3
TEXT: For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents—Team GO Rocket and its leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5
TEXT: She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pokémon, and a heart full of passion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6
TEXT: With that in mind, I think it’s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1
TEXT: Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2
TEXT: To me, there’s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3
TEXT: There’s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pokémon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4
TEXT: No matter your skill level, what team you’re on, or the Pokémon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that’s what the Trainer community is all about!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5
TEXT: I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers—because that’s part of your next task!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6
TEXT: It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2
TEXT: Hopefully you even found a Pokémon that’ll make a great addition to your team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3
TEXT: I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4
TEXT: Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5
TEXT: And remember—the journey is just as important as the destination!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0
TEXT: I knew I’d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1
TEXT: But before we begin this challenge, let’s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2
TEXT: In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that’s better.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3
TEXT: A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand—and you’ll need plenty of focus for what I’ll be throwing your way next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4
TEXT: Get it? “Throwing”? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5
TEXT: Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don’t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6
TEXT: Training can be hard work, but don’t forget it’s supposed to be fun, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0
TEXT: Impressive work, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1
TEXT: I don’t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2
TEXT: Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3
TEXT: Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4
TEXT: Everyone’s path is different, and I’ll always encourage you to find your own. There’s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5
TEXT: I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It’s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6
TEXT: Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time—we’ll regroup when you’re finished!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1
TEXT: Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2
TEXT: We’re approaching the end of this challenge, and I’m not ashamed to say it’s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you’ve grown.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3
TEXT: I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4
TEXT: Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pokémon to their full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5
TEXT: As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6
TEXT: I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I’ll be here to congratulate you when you’re done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0
TEXT: Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You’ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it’s been an honor to work alongside you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1
TEXT: It’s been astonishing to witness the growth you’ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pokémon Trainer. You’re an incredible talent, and I hope you’ll put your skills to use.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2
TEXT: You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you’ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3
TEXT: The world of Pokémon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4
TEXT: Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pokémon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid—and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there’s nothing you can’t do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5
TEXT: I can only hope you’re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don’t worry—I’ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I’ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There’s always something more to discover, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I’m sure you know what I’m about to say, so before I get too choked up—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—perfect timing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_1
TEXT: Come look at this. See that there, in the dirt?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—footprints! Though not human ones, I’d wager.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_3
TEXT: You’d be hard pressed to find shoes that would fit whatever feet made these, I think! There must be a Pokémon responsible, though I’m not sure which one...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_4
TEXT: I’m going to stick around and see if I can’t learn a bit more from these footprints, so why don’t you follow them and see where they take you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_5
TEXT: Make sure to snap some photos of your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! That Ground-type Pokémon you caught looks spectacular.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that Drilbur, the Mole Pokémon, can dig through the ground at incredible speeds?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_2
TEXT: In the Galar region, Drilbur often leave farmers in a tizzy because they damage their crops. Sounds like mole than they can handle, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, while you were out, I received reports that the Pokémon we’re looking for has vines on its body.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_4
TEXT: How about you search the bushes nearby to see if you can find any vines? Don’t forget to snap some photos, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You got a great shot of that Bug-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_1
TEXT: I encountered a curious Bug-type Pokémon myself, actually: Combee.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Tiny Bee Pokémon, Combee is actually a trio! The three work together to collect honey and deliver it to their colony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_3
TEXT: Such abundant teamwork sure is admirable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_4
TEXT: I’m sure our team leaders strive to achieve that same level of synergy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, the Combee I saw got me thinking: Maybe we’ve been searching too close to the ground. If my hypothesis is correct, we’re on the trail of a Pokémon that can sometimes be seen hopping from tree to tree.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_6
TEXT: This time, try searching among the trees to see if you can find any leads. And don’t forget to photograph your findings!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Sweet Nuzleaf.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_1
TEXT: I believe the Pokémon we’re after tends to live deep in forests—much like Nuzleaf does—so we should be on the right track.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_2
TEXT: Ah, look—your Nuzleaf just started playing its grass flute!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_3
TEXT: The sound of it is said to make its listeners uneasy. I wonder if it’s trying to lead the Pokémon out into the open...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_4
TEXT: Wait, what was that?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_5
TEXT: Look there! A dark shadow just dashed across the sky! Keep your eyes up, %PLAYERNAME%, and chase after it! Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_0
TEXT: Great job out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_1
TEXT: The photo you sent me speaks to your efforts. And I see you made a new friend in that Rufflet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_2
TEXT: Did you know that Rufflet will challenge Pokémon stronger than itself, even if it might lose? That’s how it pushes itself to grow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_3
TEXT: Pretty brave, huh? I think bravery is exactly what we’ll need as we prepare to encounter the mysterious Pokémon we’ve been tracking.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_4
TEXT: Thanks to all the information we’ve gathered, I’m certain that we’re dealing with Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_5
TEXT: The Mythical Pokémon Zarude tend to live in packs in the forest, but it looks like the one we’ve been following is all on its own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_6
TEXT: Sounds like the perfect chance to catch it, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_7
TEXT: With everything we’ve learned—and all the Pokémon friends you’ve made along the way—I’m sure you’ll succeed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_0
TEXT: ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_1
TEXT: Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I’ve seen recently.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_2
TEXT: What, you didn’t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pokémon is my greatest passion, I’ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pokémon as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_3
TEXT: Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I’ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_4
TEXT: Also, a lot of movies feature Pokémon! Don’t you love it when your interests overlap?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_5
TEXT: I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_6
TEXT: Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_7
TEXT: Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They’re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_8
TEXT: Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That’s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_9
TEXT: Could you head out and learn more about Machop?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you’ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_1
TEXT: The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_2
TEXT: Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_3
TEXT: Isn’t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pokémon, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_4
TEXT: A Machoke’s muscular body is so powerful, the Pokémon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_5
TEXT: As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It’s almost like you’re living out that movie yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_0
TEXT: Wow—that’s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_1
TEXT: Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn’t that dedication amazing?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_2
TEXT: It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_3
TEXT: Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pokémon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_4
TEXT: Oops, there I go again… Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pokémon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_5
TEXT: Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_6
TEXT: Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp’s signature move. Haha, who knew I’d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_7
TEXT: Moving right along…

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_8
TEXT: How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let’s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_1
TEXT: The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn’t have done it without his Machamp by his side.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_2
TEXT: Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pokémon and their Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_3
TEXT: I suppose you and Machamp don’t need to watch that particular film, though—you practically lived it today! It’s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_4
TEXT: You never know what you’ll discover about yourself when you try new things—just like how you never know which Pokémon you’ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I’ll see you next time. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1
TEXT: All morning, I’ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it’s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2
TEXT: Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3
TEXT: Guess it’s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4
TEXT: Anyway, I think it’ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they’re harmless.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5
TEXT: However, I see potential in this Pokémon. It’s time to head out and investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that’s something I’d like to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2
TEXT: Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pokémon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3
TEXT: I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don’t you think? Let’s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4
TEXT: Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they’re quite useful as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0
TEXT: Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you’ve completed, it’s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1
TEXT: Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn’t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2
TEXT: Known as the Atrocious Pokémon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3
TEXT: So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type—something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4
TEXT: Looks like you’ll be adding a powerful Pokémon to your team, but let’s proceed with caution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you’ve got yourself a Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1
TEXT: I’m sure this Pokémon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2
TEXT: Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3
TEXT: I’m excited to see what kinds of challenges you’ll demolish together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4
TEXT: Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles—not entire cities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I’ve just encountered something strange!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze—but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2
TEXT: Curious, isn’t it? I suspect it’s the work of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3
TEXT: There’s one that’s known to dislike cold areas so much, it’ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4
TEXT: I believe there are large groups of this particular Pokémon appearing all over the place right now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5
TEXT: Ah, you’re wondering which Pokémon I’m talking about? I think I’ll keep that to myself for now. But here—I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6
TEXT: Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1
TEXT: As promised, I’ll now reveal my guess as to which Pokémon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2
TEXT: My intuition is pretty “lit,” eh? Am I using that ri—AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4
TEXT: When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn’t that just incredible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5
TEXT: And to think that this intimidating Pokémon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6
TEXT: As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn’t stop me from trying to hug it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though—I’ll have more hot tips for you then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0
TEXT: You’re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pokémon. Exciting stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2
TEXT: Watch out for the ends of its arms, though—they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3
TEXT: Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that’s pretty fun! Fwoosh!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4
TEXT: There I go getting fired up about Pokémon again. Get it? “Fired up”? Haha, my hot streak continues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you’ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon—so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve got your very own Magmortar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1
TEXT: Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2
TEXT: Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3
TEXT: Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4
TEXT: See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How’ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I’ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we’ve been seeing quite a few Pokémon that were first found in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: And you—you’ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola’s island guardians!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: I can’t say I’m completely free of envy, but I’m glad you were able to have those experiences.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5
TEXT: I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I’d sure like to hope so! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6
TEXT: Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that—you’ve caught all of Alola’s first partner Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: They make for quite the iconic trio.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our Alola-inspired research today!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Which of Alola’s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region’s island challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: There’s even a Trainers’ School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don’t you go meet some new Pokémon and send some Gifts to your friends?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2
TEXT: As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3
TEXT: I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you take a stroll yourself? I’ll be here when you get back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Ula’Ula Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2
TEXT: As we’ve discussed, Ula’Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola’s very own Pokémon League?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3
TEXT: It’s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4
TEXT: In that spirit, why don’t you head out and find some new Pokémon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0
TEXT: So you’re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there—it’s one of my favorites as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1
TEXT: Though perhaps that isn’t saying much... They’re all my favorites, really! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2
TEXT: Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola’s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3
TEXT: I’ve heard you can even meet some Pokémon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4
TEXT: In the spirit of Poni Island—and as an act of public service—why don’t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but I’ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pokémon, and even its guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2
TEXT: If there’s one thing I love about Pokémon, it’s that there’s always something new to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3
TEXT: But to be honest with you, I was hoping we’d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola’s guardian deities here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4
TEXT: They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could’ve spurred them to come here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5
TEXT: Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary—maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6
TEXT: Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7
TEXT: Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8
TEXT: For now, continue your island research. I’ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon. For now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3a_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Did your friends like their Gifts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3b_0
TEXT: Welcome back! How was your adventure? Did you see anything new? You’ll have to tell me all about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3c_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Let me take a look at the Pokémon you’ve returned with... I bet with some training, you and your Pokémon would be ready to take on Alola’s Pokémon League yourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3d_0
TEXT: Welcome back! I knew you’d have no trouble with Team GO Rocket. You never do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I’ve got an exciting adventure for you. I’ve been working on something...BIG.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1
TEXT: Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2
TEXT: After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3
TEXT: It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I’ve never encountered before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4
TEXT: I’d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5
TEXT: After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pokémon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6
TEXT: It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7
TEXT: Now that I’ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let’s get started on some research. We’ll need a Weedle—I think that Pokémon has mega potential!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s document our findings for other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1
TEXT: Now, Weedle can’t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2
TEXT: My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pokémon and that each Pokémon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3
TEXT: It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pokémon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4
TEXT: It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pokémon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pokémon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5
TEXT: Maybe it’s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer’s bond with their Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6
TEXT: Let’s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0
TEXT: Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1
TEXT: I’ve learned that some other Pokémon can Mega Evolve, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2
TEXT: While I’ve been able to confirm only a few, I’m sure we’ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you’re ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3
TEXT: Now, I’m sure you are going to ask, “Professor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pokémon?”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4
TEXT: Well, don’t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pokémon for both you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6
TEXT: I’m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pokémon have on other Pokémon when they battle together. Why don’t you give it a try!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0
TEXT: I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1
TEXT: I’ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon can do many other things together, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2
TEXT: I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pokémon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are extremely powerful, so I think it’s best that we don’t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4
TEXT: I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project—a Mega Bracelet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5
TEXT: In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pokémon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won’t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_6
TEXT: However, I thought a Mega Bracelet would be a trendy way to show off your Mega Evolution skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_7
TEXT: You can check it out when you want to change up your look. I hope you accept this gift with my sincerest thanks for a job well done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_8
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_1
TEXT: I have something exciting planned for you today—you could even say it’s a mega surprise! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_2
TEXT: I still have a few loose ends to wrap up, though.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3
TEXT: While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pokémon are out and about today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4
TEXT: I’ll be ready by the time you’re back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0
TEXT: Ah, good—you’re back. I’ve just finished getting everything ready.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1
TEXT: Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pokémon lately?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2
TEXT: Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3
TEXT: Let’s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_4
TEXT: First, let’s choose which of these Pokémon you’d like to be the star of our research, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_5
TEXT: Once we’re done, our understanding of Mega Evolution will be second to none.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Venusaur, the Seed Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1
TEXT: Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s rays, it fills its body with power.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2
TEXT: While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Charizard, the Flame Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1
TEXT: Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_2
TEXT: While I fetch Charizard, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_0
TEXT: So, you’ve chosen Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_1
TEXT: The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_2
TEXT: While I fetch Blastoise, how about you go out and catch a few Pokémon as a warm-up. Don’t forget to power them up, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1c_3
TEXT: You’ll have an even more formidable team by your side in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_1
TEXT: Some theorize that a strong bond between a Trainer and a Pokémon is the key to Mega Evolution. We’ve also seen that Mega Energy can play a role.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_2
TEXT: However, I noticed recently that if you Mega Evolve your Pokémon once using Mega Energy, you won’t need to use Mega Energy to Mega Evolve that Pokémon again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2a_3
TEXT: Let’s Mega Evolve Venusaur and see if that’s true for ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2b_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Now that we’re fully warmed up, let’s tuck into our research on Mega Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2b_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_2c_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_0
TEXT: What a magnificent Mega Venusaur, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_1
TEXT: Let’s keep growing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Venusaur? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_2
TEXT: Mega-Evolved Pokémon are powerful allies. Their strength in battle is unmatched!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3a_3
TEXT: I’m sure there’s more to learn about Mega Evolution, so why stop now? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3b_0

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3b_1

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3c_0
TEXT: What a brilliant Mega Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_3c_1
TEXT: Let’s keep our progress flowing: why don’t you take on a Raid Battle with your mighty Mega Blastoise? There may even be a Team GO Rocket Grunt lurking about, looking for a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you, as always.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_1
TEXT: I’m feeling especially refreshed today, as if a pleasant island breeze was following me. Maybe it’s the freshly squeezed Pinap Juice I had for breakfast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_2
TEXT: Or maybe it’s because more and more Pokémon first discovered in the Alola region have been coming to visit me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_3
TEXT: Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It’s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_4
TEXT: Alola even has Pokémon whose appearances are different than their counterparts in other regions. You may have encountered some of them before!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you try looking for some Pokémon that were first discovered in Alola while I rustle up another glass of juice? I’m sure we have a lot to learn about our visitors!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_0
TEXT: Good timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I just finished my juice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_1
TEXT: Thanks for looking into the Alola region’s Pokémon! You’re as diligent as ever.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_2
TEXT: Let me take a look at what you’ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pokémon you just met can be found on Alola’s Melemele Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_3
TEXT: Melemele Island is where many of Alola’s Trainers begin their island challenge. It’s very fitting that the Pokémon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_4
TEXT: Now, let’s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pokémon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_0
TEXT: Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pokémon already seem to be closer. But who doesn’t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it’s time for another glass of juice...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_1
TEXT: Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island’s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_2
TEXT: Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_3
TEXT: The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pokémon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_4
TEXT: Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I’m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What’s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That’s incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_1
TEXT: And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he’d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2
TEXT: I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pokémon brimming with curiosity—but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_3
TEXT: Or did someone do something to anger it? I’ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4
TEXT: Do you think we’ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn’t that be something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_5
TEXT: I guess we’ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let’s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pokémon wearing fun costumes recently? I’ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_1
TEXT: It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I’m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_2
TEXT: Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pokémon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pokémon feel when they wear those costumes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_3
TEXT: Sounds to me like some research is in order!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_1
TEXT: I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who’d been sorting through some Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_2
TEXT: Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pokémon that rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_3
TEXT: Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_4
TEXT: I wonder how different Pokémon react to different foods. While I go on a Berry run, why don’t you do some research on how Pokémon feel after eating?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full—and my stomach rumbly! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_1
TEXT: Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_2
TEXT: I wasn’t able to look into it further at the time—my hands were quite full with Berries—but I’m hoping we can investigate it together soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_3
TEXT: For now, could you continue researching how people and Pokémon express themselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_4
TEXT: For many Trainers and their Pokémon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pokémon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go out and see for yourself? I’ll be cheering you on from here!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_1
TEXT: While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_2
TEXT: Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_3
TEXT: Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you’ll be able to catch Meloetta’s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you’d find a way to catch Meloetta’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_1
TEXT: They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it’s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_2
TEXT: I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I’m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_0
TEXT: Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%—I didn’t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_2
TEXT: Whether it’s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pokémon battle or battle of the bands, there’s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What’s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_3
TEXT: Maybe you’re still figuring it out—and that’s totally fine. Everyone’s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support—and Meloetta’s, too. Now, let’s get out there and show the world who we are!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s always great to see you! I’m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1
TEXT: That’s why I’ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I’ll be asking!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2
TEXT: I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pokémon that has really sent me and other Pokémon researchers into quite a tizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3
TEXT: Can you believe an undiscovered Pokémon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4
TEXT: I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don’t worry, though... I’m sure the repairs won’t cost me too much at the shop...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5
TEXT: Although each Pokémon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn’t put a damper on my day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6
TEXT: So many Ditto taking on this unique Pokémon form must mean that the real Pokémon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7
TEXT: Let’s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don’t have much to go on, but I’m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8
TEXT: But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0
TEXT: Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you’ll gather in the field.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1
TEXT: While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pokémon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn’t have much luck.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2
TEXT: But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pokémon has been unseen until just recently, I think it’s safe to say that we’re tracking another Mythical Pokémon, like Mew and Celebi.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3
TEXT: If I’m right and this elusive Pokémon is a Mythical Pokémon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4
TEXT: But let’s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5
TEXT: Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I’m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_6
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pokémon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it—don’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1
TEXT: Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_2
TEXT: What luck! Did you know that when Professor Oak was my instructor, he was my role model? And he still is!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3
TEXT: He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pokémon, so I really think we’re on to something!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4
TEXT: Still, a name alone isn’t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don’t?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_5
TEXT: I think that if we find Ditto, we’ll be able to figure out how they acquired this curious transformation, and maybe that will lead us to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_6
TEXT: Observation will be the best way forward, so let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_7
TEXT: Please complete the following tasks.
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you’ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1
TEXT: This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn’t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2
TEXT: But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_3
TEXT: In order to make more progress, I think we should study these types of Pokémon! Can you complete the following tasks?
{0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_0
TEXT: Great news, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks to all the data you’ve collected, I was able to make a detailed study of the differences between Electric-type Pokémon and Steel-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_1
TEXT: Thankfully, the Ditto was able to use Transform one more time! It took me some time to figure out it was attracted to all my metal equipment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2
TEXT: Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto’s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_3
TEXT: I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4
TEXT: I think our next step is to study more Pokémon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pokémon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_5
TEXT: {0}
{1}
{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_6
TEXT: Oh, and one more thing—Professor Oak is also studying a Ditto in his own lab that is able to Transform into Meltan. With our parallel research, I think we’ll be able to make some breakthroughs soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_7
TEXT: By the time you complete all the research tasks, I should be able to circle back to you with the latest development.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_0
TEXT: Just in the nick of time, %PLAYERNAME%! With careful study of the Ditto that I sent him and the small amount of documented Meltan encounters, Professor Oak was able to solve more mysteries related to this Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1
TEXT: Meltan very well may have split from a Pokémon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pokémon that can divide into multiple, independent Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_2
TEXT: This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_3
TEXT: Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal—because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_4
TEXT: Do you know what Pokémon we should research next? You’re bright, %PLAYERNAME%, so I know you know the answer! I need you to collect data on Pokémon for which several parts can come together and act as one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_5
TEXT: Can you complete the following tasks?

{2}

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_0
TEXT: Wow, I’m impressed! %PLAYERNAME%! Your data has arrived just as I’ve finished putting pieces of evidence together to learn Melmetal’s place in history.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_1
TEXT: According to these records, Melmetal was once regarded as a sacred being in a secluded community deep inside a wooded land that was rich with magnetite-bearing sedimentary rock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_2
TEXT: People there developed ways to make unique tools out of metal shed by Melmetal. Without such metal, they couldn’t have made these tools back then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_6_3
TEXT: We need to find out more about Pokémon that wield tools. Could you complete the following research tasks?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_0
TEXT: I just received an important piece of news, %PLAYERNAME%! Remember the ancient text? It seems that a mysterious box was also excavated from the same site where the ancient text was found.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_1
TEXT: There was nothing in the box except a rusty lump of metal that bears interesting similarities to Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_2
TEXT: Perhaps exposing the box to this vast natural environment could cause something enigmatic to happen, resulting in Meltan changing states as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_3
TEXT: Exposing this metal to the open air could have had an entirely different effect on what’s inside the box, but we won’t know until we try it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_7_4
TEXT: We may be able to find a clue about the lump of metal by delving into the world of ancient Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_0
TEXT: I was right, %PLAYERNAME%! This artifact is truly Meltan! We did it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1
TEXT: Of course, the reason for Meltan’s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pokémon somehow split itself apart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_2
TEXT: Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_3
TEXT: Make sure you give Meltan plenty of chances to see the vast world we live in by venturing out and exploring! Who knows what will happen from here...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_4
TEXT: Enjoy exploring, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’m sure we’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, how are you? It’s been a while, hasn’t it? You’ve become quite the Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to ask for your help. As you know, I study Pokémon and their habitats. I’ve learned a lot over the years, but recently, I’ve found some hints of something mysterious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_2
TEXT: I was wondering if you would help me investigate what's going on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_3
TEXT: You will? That’s great!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_0_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_0
TEXT: Great. Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! Now I should be able to detect anything out of the ordinary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_1
TEXT: I believe we need to be on the lookout for a Mythical Pokémon! Mythical Pokémon are extremely rare and unique, and many consider their existence to be mere rumor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_1_2
TEXT: Could you help get my equipment set up around your local habitat? This’ll be a great time to take your buddy out to explore a bit and hatch some Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_0
TEXT: Incredible! This confirms my initial suspicion. I think we’re seeing evidence of Mew!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_1
TEXT: A Pokémon found in a jungle far to the south that was thought to have been extinct. It is so rare that many experts say that it is a myth. %BREAK%Only a few people have seen it worldwide. Apparently, it appears only to those people who are pure of heart and have a strong desire to see it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_2
TEXT: My colleagues in Kanto, including my instructor, Professor Oak, spent a long time studying Mew. It looks like our findings match theirs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_3
TEXT: According to our research, Mew was said to be observed using moves of all kinds. This observation has led some of us to say that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_2_4

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_4_3

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mew_7_2
TEXT: My assistants and I will request some Special Research from you in the future. Stay in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I’d love to see a Mudkip, when—wouldn’t you know it—I came across a whole mess of them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_1
TEXT: Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water’s edge? Sounds adorable, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_2
TEXT: One of the many things that’s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_3
TEXT: When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_4
TEXT: It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_5
TEXT: Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you’ve brought a Mudkip with you—nice work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_1
TEXT: Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what’s going on around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_2
TEXT: I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip’s Evolution, Marshtomp.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_3
TEXT: Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp’s legs sturdy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_4
TEXT: And because it’s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_5
TEXT: While I clean my coat off, why don’t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_0
TEXT: I knew I should’ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That’s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_1
TEXT: Don’t you think it’s inspiring how Pokémon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_2
TEXT: Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert—Marshtomp’s Evolution—while you were away!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_3
TEXT: Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_4
TEXT: I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_5
TEXT: ...What’s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that’s an option... But not quite as fun, don’t you think? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_6
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pokémon really are incredible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_1
TEXT: Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it’s strong enough to tow a large ship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_2
TEXT: I guess you know which Pokémon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_3
TEXT: You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_4
TEXT: It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pokémon. I hope you’ve enjoyed yourself today as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_5
TEXT: As for me, I think it’s time I stomp on home. I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0
TEXT: Hi there! It’s so nice to meet you, %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow. I’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’ll be guiding you on your journey—and what a journey it shall be!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1
TEXT: You’ll also be helping me with my research along the way. So really, we’re more like colleagues!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2
TEXT: First things first—let’s go over how to catch Pokémon, make a Curveball Throw, and transfer Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3
TEXT: You can catch Pokémon with Poké Balls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4
TEXT: If you throw a Poké Ball at the center of the Pokémon and time your throw just right, you can even achieve a Nice, Great, or Excellent Throw!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5
TEXT: Curveball Throws are advanced throws that can help you grow even more as a Trainer. To make a Curveball Throw, spin the Poké Ball as you throw it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6
TEXT: It’s OK if you don’t get it at first. That’s what practice is for!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7
TEXT: Once you’ve caught some Pokémon, you can keep them in your Pokémon storage or transfer them to my mobile lab in exchange for Candy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8
TEXT: I’ll explain more about Candy later. For now, how about you go catch some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching Pokémon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1
TEXT: Soon, you’ll be making Excellent Curveball Throws as easily as a Goldeen swims in water!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2
TEXT: Next, I’d like to talk to you about an item that I’ve created called Incense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3
TEXT: It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pokémon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4
TEXT: If you know you’re going to be out adventuring for a while, using Incense can really boost the amount of Pokémon you encounter. It’s one of my favorite items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5
TEXT: Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several different types that Pokémon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6
TEXT: For example, Nanab Berries calm Pokémon down, making it easier for you to aim a Poké Ball at them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7
TEXT: How about you give these items a try? Go ahead and use an Incense to attract Pokémon. Then, use Nanab Berries to help you catch them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work using Incense and Berries to help you catch Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1
TEXT: If you’re ever running low on Berries or Poké Balls, you can visit PokéStops to get more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2
TEXT: Spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop can grant you those items as well as other goodies. You can also get Field Research tasks by doing so, which you can complete to encounter Pokémon or receive items.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3
TEXT: PokéStops are usually located at interesting places, like a monument, a public park, or a local café.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4
TEXT: They encourage Trainers to explore the world around them. Isn’t that exciting?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go do some exploring? Who knows—you might discover some interesting places!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I just returned from a stroll myself. One thing I love about Field Research is how it always manages to take me to new and exciting locations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1
TEXT: I hope you get to learn a bit more about the world around you as you seek out different PokéStops!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2
TEXT: And as fun as that will be, it’ll be even more fun if you bring along a Buddy Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3
TEXT: Building strong relationships with your Pokémon is pivotal to being a good Trainer—and choosing a Pokémon to be your buddy is a great way to do just that!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_4
TEXT: You can choose any Pokémon to be your Buddy Pokémon. It can even walk alongside you while you’re out exploring!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_5
TEXT: To get your buddy to join you on your adventures, give it some treats, such as Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_6
TEXT: You can boost your friendship with your Buddy Pokémon even further by playing with it, taking photos of it, and battling with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_7
TEXT: Eventually, your Buddy Pokémon can even become your Best Buddy and gain a Best Buddy ribbon! You’ll also earn additional Candy when you walk around with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_8
TEXT: We’ll cover the importance of Candy later, but for now, how about you pick out a Buddy Pokémon and spend some time with it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Wow, your Buddy Pokémon’s looking pretty pleased! Seeing your bond grow stronger warms my heart.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_1
TEXT: Keep taking care of your Pokémon to make your relationship flourish!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_2
TEXT: I see you’ve earned some Candy while exploring with your buddy, too. It’s now time to learn how you can get more Candy, as well as what you can use it for.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_3
TEXT: You can earn Candy by catching, transferring, and adventuring with Pokémon. You can then use that Candy to power up and evolve your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_4
TEXT: You’ll also need Stardust, which you can earn by catching Pokémon, hatching Eggs, completing research, and opening Gifts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_5
TEXT: Evolving Pokémon helps you fill out your Pokédex and learn all about your Pokémon’s potential. There are even some Pokémon that evolve in unique ways.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_6
TEXT: Be sure to check the Pokémon in your Pokémon storage to learn more about how to evolve them. You’ll also be able to power up your Pokémon there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_7
TEXT: If you need help figuring out which Pokémon to power up and evolve, you can ask your team leader to appraise your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_4_8
TEXT: You should have some Candy and Stardust from completing previous research tasks. How about you use them to evolve and power up some Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Pokémon look stronger than ever. Did you learn anything new while evolving and powering up your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_1
TEXT: When I see a Pokémon discover new possibilities within itself, it makes me feel like I’m capable of anything, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_2
TEXT: But as exciting as that all is, there’s just as much to learn about Pokémon in some of their earliest forms, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_3
TEXT: Next, we’re going to discuss Eggs and Pokémon that can hatch from them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_4
TEXT: You can get 2 km, 5 km, and 10 km Eggs by spinning PokéStops, and you can get 7 km Eggs by opening Gifts from your friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_5
TEXT: To hatch these Eggs, you’ll need to place them in an Incubator and travel the indicated distance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_6
TEXT: If you want to hatch Eggs even faster, Super Incubators decrease the distance required to hatch Eggs. Be sure to use these Incubators wisely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_7
TEXT: You’ll be able to get Eggs in other ways, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_8
TEXT: For example, you can get Strange Eggs by defeating Team GO Rocket Leaders. As you go on your Trainer journey, you’ll have opportunities to take on Team GO Rocket and obtain these Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_5_9
TEXT: You should have a handful of Eggs already. How about you get to hatching some?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_0
TEXT: Look at all the Eggs you’ve hatched, %PLAYERNAME%! What an accomplishment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_1
TEXT: Being a dedicated Trainer takes quite a bit of work, wouldn’t you say? Even so, you can’t forget to have fun along the way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_2
TEXT: You’ll see in your Item Bag that you have a camera. You can use this camera to take snapshots of your Pokémon and commemorate all sorts of moments and memories.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_3
TEXT: You can take a snapshot when encountering wild Pokémon, when viewing your Pokémon in your Pokémon storage, and when interacting with your buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_6_4
TEXT: How about you give it a shot? A...snapshot, that is. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I’ve been looking through the photos you took, and I have to say, I’m quite impressed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_1
TEXT: Have you considered moonlighting as a Pokémon photographer? You certainly have the chops for it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_10
TEXT: An important part of battling effectively is using attacks that are super effective against the Pokémon defending the Gym.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_11
TEXT: Different Pokémon and their attacks have different types, and those types have weaknesses to other types. For example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak against Water-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_12
TEXT: I’d like for you to try using supereffective attacks when battling at a Gym. Try using Charged Attacks of different types to see which ones work best.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_13
TEXT: Let’s see what you’re made of, %PLAYERNAME%! Get out there and battle in some Gyms.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_2
TEXT: Do you recognize these structures? I’m sure you’ve come across them in your photographic forays.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_3
TEXT: They’re called Gyms, and they’ll prove to be quite important in your Trainer journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_4
TEXT: Gyms are always one of four colors, depending on which team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_5
TEXT: Red Gyms are controlled by Team Valor, led by the headstrong Candela. Blue Gyms are controlled by Team Mystic, headed up by the analytical Blanche.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_6
TEXT: Yellow Gyms are controlled by Team Instinct, whose proud leader is the incomparable Spark. He’s known for following his gut.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_7
TEXT: Gray Gyms are neutral, meaning that no team controls them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_8
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by your team, you can assign a Pokémon to defend it. Gyms can have up to six Pokémon defending them at a time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_7_9
TEXT: If a Gym is controlled by another team, you can battle to try to claim it. Find a Gym that’s controlled by a different team, and give battling a shot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_0
TEXT: How was your Gym experience, %PLAYERNAME%? A unique kind of workout, isn’t it? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_1
TEXT: Anyhoo, did you notice that at some Gyms, you were faced with a single Pokémon instead of Gym defenders?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_2
TEXT: Those Pokémon are called Raid Bosses, and you can challenge them in Raid Battles!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_3
TEXT: In Raid Battles, you can battle alongside friends and other Trainers to challenge a Raid Boss.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_4
TEXT: These Pokémon are formidable foes, indeed. Sometimes, you can find certain Pokémon only as Raid Bosses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_5
TEXT: Before entering a Raid Battle, make sure to power up your Pokémon! Stocking up on lots of Candy and Stardust will allow you to bring powerful teams to Raid Battles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_6
TEXT: Power up some Pokémon, then try taking on a raid. If you don’t succeed, you can team up with other Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_8_7
TEXT: You’ll never know what you’re capable of until you try, right?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m hoping you can help me with something. You see, I was out for a walk recently and noticed several trees covered in slash marks—and I think I know what made them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_1
TEXT: There’s a Pokémon called Oshawott—the Sea Otter Pokémon—that keeps a scalchop on its stomach that it can detach and use as a blade. I’ve seen a lot of Oshawott around lately, so I’m thinking they may be our mystery tree carvers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_0_2
TEXT: Could you catch some Oshawott so we can learn more about them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Did you know that Oshawott uses the scalchop on its stomach not only to fight but also to break open hard berries? Gotta love a good multitool.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about Oshawott, I was hoping we could turn our attention to its Evolution, Dewott. Don’t let its cute appearance fool you—Dewott takes itself very seriously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_1_2
TEXT: Also known as the Discipline Pokémon, Dewott uses strict training to learn its flowing double-scalchop technique. I’d love to see Dewott’s fighting in action! Can you evolve your Oshawott for me, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_0
TEXT: Wow, Dewott’s double-scalchop technique is incredible! Pokémon truly never cease to amaze, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_1
TEXT: I barely have the coordination to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time, and here we have Pokémon mastering bespoke battle techniques. It’s inspiring stuff!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_2
TEXT: I think I’ve gained a better understanding of Dewott—which means we can begin studying its Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_3
TEXT: Dewott’s Evolution, Samurott, is known to wield swords called seamitars incorporated in its armor. Apparently, Samurott can draw and sheathe its seamitars in the time it takes a foe to blink.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_2_4
TEXT: Not hard to see why it’s known as the Formidable Pokémon! Why don’t you evolve Dewott so we can witness Samurott’s majesty for ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! That’s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_1
TEXT: Thanks for all your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. We’ve learned so much about Oshawott, Dewott, and Samurott—and from them, too! I’ll “sea” you next time! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is impeccable. Because you know what? I’ve had enough!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2
TEXT: That’s right—I’ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I’ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3
TEXT: Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_4
TEXT: Tapu Fini is the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_5
TEXT: Terrible calamities sometimes befall those who recklessly approach Tapu Fini, so I’m going to think very carefully about how we can successfully—and safely—track it down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_6
TEXT: In the meantime, can you see what Team GO Rocket is up to? I’d like to avoid any complications in our search.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_1
TEXT: I’ve been busy researching Tapu Fini. My sources say that it can manipulate water, and it lives deep within a thick fog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2
TEXT: With that in mind, I’d hazard a guess that we’ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini’s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pokémon are appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3
TEXT: I’ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche’s water safety spiel already...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4
TEXT: But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5
TEXT: Now, let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_1
TEXT: I was knee-deep in the last lake I thought to check—shoes soggy, Dewpider on all sides—when I finally, FINALLY, saw Tapu Fini!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_2
TEXT: I’d love to tell you more about it, but I need to scribble down all the details in my journal while they’re fresh in my mind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_3
TEXT: You should head out and see if you can catch a glimpse of Tapu Fini yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_0
TEXT: Phew! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. How’d you fare?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_1
TEXT: You saw Tapu Fini as well?! That’s fantastic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_2
TEXT: Now you’ve seen all four of Alola’s guardian deities. And I’ve seen...all of one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_3
TEXT: That’s... Well, it’s one more than I’d seen before, isn’t it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4
TEXT: Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others’ good fortune...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5
TEXT: Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they’ve appeared here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6
TEXT: Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now—but instead, we’ve been the ones tracking them down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7
TEXT: It’s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they’re investigating the area for a reason.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8
TEXT: But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again! I’m always grateful to have a helping hand with my research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1
TEXT: Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2
TEXT: Well, I’m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3
TEXT: I’d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pokémon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1
TEXT: I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2
TEXT: Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_3
TEXT: Porygon have made a name for themselves by protecting cyberspace from suspicious activity! For something artificial, they sure do seem caring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4
TEXT: Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5
TEXT: Well, in the meantime, I’d like to learn more about Porygon’s evolved form, Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6
TEXT: I have a hunch that you’ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1
TEXT: Thanks to your efforts, I’ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2
TEXT: According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3
TEXT: The power of science is just astounding, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4
TEXT: These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_5
TEXT: I wonder what this means for Porygon’s final Evolution, Porygon-Z?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_6
TEXT: For your next batch of research, I want you to evolve Porygon2 into Porygon-Z using a Sinnoh Stone. Good luck out there, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_0
TEXT: Congrats on evolving your Porygon2 into a Porygon-Z, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_1
TEXT: I’ve uncovered some notes about this Pokémon that I thought you’d find interesting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2
TEXT: According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z’s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3
TEXT: Because the update caused instability, academics can’t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4
TEXT: It’s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I’m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_5
TEXT: Your hard work is always appreciated, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll be in touch as soon as I’m in need of another inquisitive eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_6
TEXT: Until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re not going to believe this!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_1
TEXT: Have you seen those Poké Ball–like Pokémon rolling about?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_10
TEXT: This all begs the question: why are Hisuian Voltorb appearing now after being absent for so long? Did they somehow travel to the present from the Sinnoh region of the past?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_11
TEXT: I have a theory that when Team GO Rocket broke open the mysterious door, it somehow caused these Hisuian Voltorb to appear in our time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_12
TEXT: Now why am I suddenly reminded of Celebi, the Time Travel Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_13
TEXT: Anyway, that’s all I’ve got! Kind of unbelievable, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_14
TEXT: I’m going to do some more digging on my end, and I’d love your help researching these bygone Pokémon out in the field!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_15
TEXT: Let’s investigate Hisuian Voltorb together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_2
TEXT: They look an awful lot like Voltorb—a Pokémon native to the Kanto region, among others—but I’ve never seen any Voltorb quite like these.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_3
TEXT: I reached out to everyone I could think of and pored over all the research documents I could get my hands on, but get this: nothing in modern scholarship mentions this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_4
TEXT: However, I did eventually find something. Did you know that the Sinnoh region used to be known as the Hisui region?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_5
TEXT: Well, I found historical documentation of an old-fashioned Poké Ball developed long ago in the Hisui region, and I realized it greatly resembles this mysterious Pokémon. Or could it be the other way around?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_6
TEXT: Which came first: the Poké Ball or the Pokémon? Who knows!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_7
TEXT: Taking all this into consideration, I believe this anomalous Pokémon is, in fact, a Voltorb that once lived in the Hisui region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_8
TEXT: Is it still a regional variant if it only existed in the past? Gosh, what a puzzle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_9
TEXT: For now, I suppose we may as well call this Pokémon Hisuian Voltorb.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_0
TEXT: I’m still reeling, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_1
TEXT: Can you believe Pokémon from a different time are now appearing around us?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_10
TEXT: Anyway. Our research sure has been exciting lately, hasn’t it, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_11
TEXT: Something tells me we’re in for even more exciting discoveries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_12
TEXT: Let’s keep at it and see what else our adventure together brings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_2
TEXT: I wonder what this Pokémon has seen in the Hisui region—and what it thinks of the future it’s suddenly seeing now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_3
TEXT: Ah, the Hisui region... I wonder what other kinds of Pokémon lived there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_4
TEXT: What I wouldn’t give to go back in time and experience the Hisui region for myself! It’d be a dream come true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_5
TEXT: Maybe if I ever meet Celebi, I could ask it for a quick trip back in time, just to sate my curiosity!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_6
TEXT: ...But I’m sure that’s not possible. It’s nice to dream, though!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_7
TEXT: Anyway, I’ve decided to research whether Hisuian Voltorb can evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_8
TEXT: I haven’t the foggiest if it can, but that won’t stop me. I want to learn everything about this strange and wonderful Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_9
TEXT: After all, it’s not every day that a literal blast from the past falls into your lap! Get it? Because Voltorb can Self-Destruct? Haha...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_0
TEXT: Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I’m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_1
TEXT: I’ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found PokéStops that look...discolored?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_2
TEXT: Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_3
TEXT: These shady characters appear to have Pokémon with a mysterious dark aura around them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_4
TEXT: As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pokémon. You never know what we might encounter...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_0
TEXT: Great job strengthening your Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_1
TEXT: After visiting one of the PokéStops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_2
TEXT: Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from PokéStops with the help of Pokémon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They’re called Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_3
TEXT: Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_4
TEXT: Help us protect local PokéStops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket abandons!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pokémon and learned some very unsettling things.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_1
TEXT: While Pokémon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pokémon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2
TEXT: As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_3
TEXT: But don’t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_4
TEXT: Can you help me purify some Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_0
TEXT: WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pokémon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_1
TEXT: After observing the purification process with Blanche, it’s clear that the Pokémon’s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_2
TEXT: Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pokémon as possible by taking back PokéStops that are under Team GO Rocket’s control!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_3
TEXT: The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there’s nothing more to this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_1
TEXT: I’m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it’s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_2
TEXT: I fear there may be trouble brewing—specifically from Team GO Rocket. They’ve been too quiet for too long, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_3
TEXT: Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything’s amiss?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they’d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests—so neither can we!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_1
TEXT: I’m relieved to see you’ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pokémon from them already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_2
TEXT: As both a professor and as someone who loves Pokémon, I can’t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_3
TEXT: Let’s get back out there and rescue some more Pokémon from them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pokémon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_1
TEXT: They’ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_2
TEXT: But those Shadow Pokémon they’ve left behind... Well, at least they’re safe with us now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_3
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, let’s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they’ll be grateful for your help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_0
TEXT: Those Pokémon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they’re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we’d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_2
TEXT: Based on how you handled those Grunts, I’m sure the Leaders won’t stand a chance!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_0
TEXT: You’ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you’ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_1
TEXT: It’s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pokémon everywhere.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_2
TEXT: Now. We’ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it’s time to let Giovanni know that we’re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_3
TEXT: I know he’s tough—but you’re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pokémon have an impressive bond—one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_1
TEXT: Pokémon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_2
TEXT: I know it won’t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you’re here to stop them right in their tracks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_3
TEXT: For now, though, get some rest. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_1
TEXT: There appears to be an increased number of Team GO Rocket members in the area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_2
TEXT: I have yet to determine what they are doing here, but I suspect that a scheme of some sort is underway.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_3
TEXT: We should investigate before they decide to cause trouble.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_0
TEXT: Thank you, Pokémon Trainer. The atmosphere is improved with fewer Team GO Rocket members present.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_1
TEXT: One detail still mystifies me. Why do the Pokémon used by Team GO Rocket possess those peculiar auras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_2
TEXT: I see. They become Shadow Pokémon through experimentation and mistreatment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_3
TEXT: So they corrupt a blameless creature, and then they abandon it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_4
TEXT: Their cruelty is unforgiveable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_5
TEXT: I am coming to realize that this group will pursue their goals relentlessly and without conscience.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_6
TEXT: We must impede them however we can.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_7
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer—let us begin by rescuing some Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_0
TEXT: Those poor Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_1
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_2
TEXT: Ah—Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_3
TEXT: Apologies for my dour demeanor. I cannot stop thinking about the Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_4
TEXT: Is there nothing we can do beyond rescuing them from Team GO Rocket? Will they remain in this state forever?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_5
TEXT: Hm? You are able to...purify them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_6
TEXT: If doing so removes their ominous aura, I would like nothing more than to observe this phenomenon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_7
TEXT: Will you show me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_0
TEXT: So this is a Purified Pokémon. Its shadowy aura is gone. In its place—radiance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_1
TEXT: You are deserving of praise, Pokémon Trainer. But our efforts cannot end here. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps we should turn our attention to Team GO Rocket members of a higher standing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_3
TEXT: If you can defeat their leaders in battle, we may hinder their plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_0
TEXT: Those battles were among the fiercest I have witnessed, Pokémon Trainer. I am fortunate to call you my ally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_1
TEXT: Regrettably, it seems the Team GO Rocket leaders were not inspired to change their ways. They, too, have abandoned their Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_2
TEXT: But surely we have at least stalled their plans. Such an expansive organization cannot function without its leaders at full strength.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_3
TEXT: Hm? We must still deal with this...Giovanni, is it? I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_4
TEXT: Then our work is not yet finished, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_0
TEXT: That was a fearsome battle, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_1
TEXT: I am dazzled by your capacity to overcome any challenge set before you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_2
TEXT: Please, relish your well-earned victory—but we must remain vigilant. If Team GO Rocket were to manipulate the Ultra Beasts...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_3
TEXT: We do not want their villainy to interfere with our endeavors.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_4
TEXT: For now, however, I think we can turn our attention back to the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_5
TEXT: So long as they remain open in your world, more Ultra Beasts could appear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_6
TEXT: Though considering the strength you displayed today, perhaps my fear is unnecessary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_7
TEXT: In any case, thank you for allowing me to observe you today. I am pleased we were able to assist so many Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_8
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. I suspect you have already noticed, but Team GO Rocket seems to be assembling en masse again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_1
TEXT: What shadowy schemes could those ruffians be plotting? They look to be glowering right at you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_2
TEXT: Surely they couldn’t be thinking of absconding with the Ultra Beasts?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_3
TEXT: Or perhaps they’ve designs on Cosmoem. In its current state, I fear—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_4
TEXT: No. Anxious speculation will not avail us. Preventative measures must come first.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_5
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. Could you use your battling skills to send some of these Grunts away?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_0
TEXT: Huh. I thought there were more Team GO Rocket Grunts around earlier...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_1
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%, it’s you! I guess I’ve got you to thank for getting those goons out of here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_2
TEXT: Rhi says they may be taking an interest in our otherworldly visitors, huh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_3
TEXT: I’m inclined to think they’re right. Good thing you’re here to save the day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_4
TEXT: Keep flushing Team GO Rocket out, %PLAYERNAME%. Try looking for their Leaders next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_5
TEXT: I’m sure you and Rhi can track them down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_0
TEXT: Brilliant work, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve managed to defeat Team GO Rocket’s Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_1
TEXT: I knew your superlative skills would lead you to victory. And you had the chance to speak with Professor Willow, correct? What did he have to say?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_2
TEXT: I see... Though I am pleased Professor Willow has corroborated my theory, I continue to be concerned for the Ultra Beasts and Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_3
TEXT: I take solace in knowing that we have dispersed the majority of Team GO Rocket, if nothing else.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_4
TEXT: Now, the time has come to challenge the man who sits atop the organization: Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_0
TEXT: So, you sent Giovanni home with his tail between his legs? Just another day in the life for you, huh, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_1
TEXT: It’s no easy feat to put Team GO Rocket back in their place, but you rose to the challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_2
TEXT: Great job! Now take some well-deserved rest with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_3
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_0
TEXT: Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_2
TEXT: The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_3
TEXT: We’re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_4
TEXT: Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_0
TEXT: Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_1
TEXT: As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_2
TEXT: I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from PokéStops. Clever little devices, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_3
TEXT: There’s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_4
TEXT: Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I’ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_0
TEXT: Interesting. It appears there’s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_1
TEXT: Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn’t underestimate Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_2
TEXT: It’s time to get battle ready, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_3
TEXT: I don’t want to send you out to face another foe without some more training.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_4
TEXT: While you sharpen your battle skills, I’ll be sure to get this little project of mine up and operational.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer. I’ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_1
TEXT: Your hard work in retrieving these components actually made my device work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_2
TEXT: If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you’ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_3
TEXT: Trainers all over the world are figuring out how to put together devices like this, and they’re identifying more hideouts than I originally anticipated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_4
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, it’s time to head to these hideouts and face whatever—or whomever—is there head on. Let’s GO.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_0
TEXT: You battled well, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve done your team leaders—and me—proud.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_1
TEXT: According to my observations, it appears the sender of that mysterious transmission during the Team GO Rocket take-over was not in attendance.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_2
TEXT: There’s someone else calling the shots—someone above Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_3
TEXT: I’ve improved on my previous invention and put together a Super Rocket Radar that should help you track this mastermind down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_4_4
TEXT: If it is who I think it is, he signs all his messages with “G.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_1
TEXT: You’ve put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s plans for the time being and rescued a special Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_2
TEXT: It’s unlikely that Giovanni will give up this easily, so I hope we can rely on you to take down Team GO Rocket members as they appear around your area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_3
TEXT: Spark, Blanche, and Candela will be on the lookout as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure Team GO Rocket will try to hatch another villainous plot soon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help holding back Team GO Rocket’s forces. It’s good to know I can rely on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_1
TEXT: However, something tells me Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so we’re in it for the long haul.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_2
TEXT: We need to think long-term about our strategy when it comes to Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_3
TEXT: I want to make sure only the most-prepared Trainers are equipped with Super Rocket Radar devices to track Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_0_4
TEXT: I know you’re an accomplished Trainer, but let’s make sure your skills are keeping up with the challenge Team GO Rocket poses.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_0
TEXT: Astounding work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_1
TEXT: You know how purifying Shadow Pokémon makes them stronger afterward due to the gratitude they feel toward you for saving them?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_2
TEXT: Maybe one of the Pokémon you purify will become a trusted partner in our efforts to fight against Team GO Rocket’s invasion.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_3
TEXT: We need to continue saving and purifying these Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_4
TEXT: Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_0
TEXT: Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. They’re practically glowing with gratitude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_1
TEXT: It’s easy to tell Shadow and Purified Pokémon apart by the auras that surround them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_2
TEXT: One of my favorite sights is a Purified Pokémon standing proud atop a Gym controlled by its Trainer’s team. It’s truly a thing to behold.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_3
TEXT: It’s time for you and your new friends to train alongside one another.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_4
TEXT: A difficult challenge awaits you, so you need to be prepared for battle, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_0
TEXT: You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_1
TEXT: The team leaders and I are certainly proud of how much you’ve grown as a Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_2
TEXT: I have one final task for you before I can be sure your skills are keeping up with an opponent like Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_3
TEXT: If you can show me that you can still defeat the Team GO Rocket Leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_3_4
TEXT: then I’ll know that you and your Pokémon are in top form.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_0
TEXT: Your skills are as impressive as ever. It’s time for you to take a Super Rocket Radar and see if you can track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_1
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, I think you’re ready to take on Giovanni again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven your strength in battle, and you’ve also shown your compassion by saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_3
TEXT: So get out there and confront Giovanni. With loyal Pokémon at your side and lots of experience under your belt, you’re unstoppable!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn’t done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_1
TEXT: While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it’s been quite thrilling!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_2
TEXT: As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_3
TEXT: We may have defeated them for the moment, but I’m sure they’ll be back and causing more trouble soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_4
TEXT: When that day comes, be sure you’re ready for the challenge!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_1
TEXT: I’m sure you’ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over PokéStops and turn even more Pokémon into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_2
TEXT: Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_3
TEXT: The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven’t given up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_4
TEXT: We need to keep working to save Pokémon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_1
TEXT: Persistence and determination are key in our continued efforts to take down Team GO Rocket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_2
TEXT: Please keep it up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_3
TEXT: It’s time to purify more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_4
TEXT: They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pokémon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_0
TEXT: How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_2
TEXT: Training isn’t a one-and-done thing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_3
TEXT: Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_4
TEXT: It’s important that you’re prepared for the challenges ahead, so let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_0
TEXT: All right! You make the team leaders—and me—proud, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_1
TEXT: It’s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we’re strong enough to hold our own.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_2
TEXT: We can’t let these bullies get in our way when we’re saving Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_0
TEXT: Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_1
TEXT: There seems to be a trend behind which Pokémon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pokémon. I’m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_2
TEXT: Could that have anything to do with why he’s here?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_3
TEXT: In any case, the time has come to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_4
TEXT: The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he’s waging these take-overs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_0
TEXT: You’ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_1
TEXT: Your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, but the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2
TEXT: Keep your eyes open, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni does not like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_4
TEXT: I’m sure I can count on you when he returns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pokémon safe!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_1
TEXT: But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_2
TEXT: Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_3
TEXT: Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We’ve come quite a long way since then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_4
TEXT: On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1
TEXT: I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pokémon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_2
TEXT: As a Pokémon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_3
TEXT: That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_4
TEXT: So let’s get out there and do just that. I’m grateful for your help, especially now. It’s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for purifying those Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_1
TEXT: Rescuing these Pokémon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_2
TEXT: Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_3
TEXT: While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I’m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I’ll be sure to let him know you said hello!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_4
TEXT: Now, it’s time to get back to work. Let’s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_0
TEXT: I’m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It’s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_1
TEXT: All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket’s attention.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_2
TEXT: Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_0
TEXT: I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you’ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I’m sure they’re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_1
TEXT: But now, Giovanni is waiting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_2
TEXT: Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong—Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_3
TEXT: There are so many resources and Pokémon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We’re counting on you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_1
TEXT: I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_2
TEXT: I’m sure he will be interested in anything you’ve learned about Shadow Pokémon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_3
TEXT: It may seem small, but every little bit helps!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn’t likely to go anywhere. I know you’ll be ready for whatever happens next!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket’s forces.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1
TEXT: Thanks to your hard work, we’ve learned so much about this enemy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket won’t be going away anytime soon, so I’m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3
TEXT: While you’ve done an amazing job so far, I’m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4
TEXT: The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn’t be a good Professor if I didn’t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_0
TEXT: As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1
TEXT: Even though we’ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I’m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pokémon keep appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2
TEXT: It seems even more Pokémon are being turned into Shadow Pokémon despite our efforts. I’ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3
TEXT: We need to keep pushing forward—those Pokémon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_4
TEXT: I’m sure you’ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1
TEXT: I’m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pokémon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2
TEXT: Your talent has made it clear that you’re ready for the next step in your preparations.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3
TEXT: Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you’re at your best!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0
TEXT: All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1
TEXT: Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I’m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2
TEXT: Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they’re holed up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete—you’re ready to take on Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1
TEXT: It’s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2
TEXT: You’ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3
TEXT: Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won’t be able to stop you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1
TEXT: Although your battle with Giovanni wasn’t easy, the skills you’ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2
TEXT: But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3
TEXT: Giovanni doesn’t like to lose, so I’m sure he’ll be back soon to further his plans.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4
TEXT: I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I’ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0
TEXT: Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I’ve given you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1
TEXT: Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2
TEXT: But there are so many aspects to Pokémon training! I think it’s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pokémon Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3
TEXT: Why not take a walk with your buddy Pokémon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4
TEXT: And be sure to rescue Shadow Pokémon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pokémon still need our help!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1
TEXT: I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pokémon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche’s research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2
TEXT: Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they’re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pokémon in danger.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3
TEXT: While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4
TEXT: I’m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won’t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket’s leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1
TEXT: I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2
TEXT: Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3
TEXT: Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0
TEXT: You’ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1
TEXT: You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2
TEXT: Great work. Now it’s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3
TEXT: Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pokémon have certainly not gone unnoticed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket’s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0
TEXT: Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1
TEXT: One interesting thing to note is that I’ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pokémon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2
TEXT: This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pokémon if they’ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3
TEXT: There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4
TEXT: For now, I need you to focus. It’s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0
TEXT: What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1
TEXT: Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I’m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2
TEXT: You’ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn’t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3
TEXT: But we can’t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket’s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4
TEXT: I’ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you, though I’m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1
TEXT: What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is—you guessed it—stirring up more trouble!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_2
TEXT: We’ve just received word that they’re doing something strange at PokéStops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_3
TEXT: What exactly they’re doing—and to what end—is what we need to figure out. Let’s get out there and see what we can find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren’t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1
TEXT: As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pokémon, which are Pokémon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2
TEXT: We’ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pokémon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_3
TEXT: More recently, Spark discovered that Team GO Rocket may be hatching a plot involving Pokémon Eggs! Is Arlo involved in this, too?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate more PokéStops and purify some Shadow Pokémon while we’re at it. Something is bound to come up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_0
TEXT: Great job saving and purifying those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1
TEXT: I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It’s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pokémon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2
TEXT: While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pokémon Egg we’re calling Strange Eggs.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3
TEXT: It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pokémon hatch from these Eggs. Let’s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_4
TEXT: The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be guarding these Strange Eggs, so let’s start by finding them. Be sure you have space for Eggs and some Incubators at the ready!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0
TEXT: Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve saved some pretty cute Pokémon in the process, if I do say so myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1
TEXT: While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2
TEXT: It appears there’s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader’s duties than just taking over PokéStops and challenging Trainers to battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_3
TEXT: First Arlo with Shadow Pokémon, and now Sierra with these Strange Eggs... I wonder what else Team GO Rocket’s got tucked up their sleeves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_4
TEXT: This doesn’t sit well with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Let’s track down those leaders again! We have to do all we can to disrupt their plans!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Hopefully that’ll keep them at bay for a little while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1
TEXT: I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that’ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he’s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1_alt
TEXT: I managed to build another Super Rocket Radar to help you track down Giovanni. But be careful—Blanche and Candela’s reports revealed that Giovanni has got a Legendary Shadow Pokémon with him!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2
TEXT: You might have encountered Shadow Mewtwo the last time Giovanni appeared. We’d thought that was the last we’d see of it, but it looks like it’s back!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_2_alt
TEXT: You need to save it, Trainer! I have no doubt Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon to nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_3
TEXT: You need to save Shadow Mewtwo, Trainer! I have a feeling Giovanni plans on using this poor Pokémon for nefarious ends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_0
TEXT: Celebrations are in order, %PLAYERNAME%. You’ve done it again—you’ve defeated Team GO Rocket’s Grunts, its leaders, and even Giovanni!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1
TEXT: Not to mention all the Shadow Pokémon you saved along the way, including Shadow Mewtwo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_1_alt
TEXT: Not only did you stop Team GO Rocket, but you also saved several Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2
TEXT: This is probably not the last that we’ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there’ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pokémon to save! Let’s get cracking, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_0
TEXT: Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I’m afraid there’s trouble afoot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_1
TEXT: That’s right—Team GO Rocket is up to no good! We’re not sure what their plan is just yet, but we know we have to stop them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You did a tremendous job defeating those Team GO Rocket Grunts and saving those poor Shadow Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_1
TEXT: While you were busy battling, I received reports that Team GO Rocket has obtained a Flying-type Legendary Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_2
TEXT: Blanche is doing recon as we speak in hopes of figuring out exactly which Legendary Pokémon we’re dealing with. I have no doubt we’ll have more information soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_1_3
TEXT: While we wait, why don’t you conduct some research on Flying-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_0
TEXT: Thanks for catching all those Flying-type Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_1
TEXT: Blanche and I have been analyzing them to help us learn more about the Legendary Pokémon that Team GO Rocket captured.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, our current hypothesis points to this Pokémon being one that’s near and dear to the team leaders’ hearts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_2_3
TEXT: While we gather more information, could you head back out into the field? We can’t let Team GO Rocket continue its plan unopposed!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. I see you’ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_1
TEXT: As impressive as this Pokémon is, though, it doesn’t seem to be the Flying-type Pokémon we've heard about in our reports.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_2
TEXT: Blanche’s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pokémon, so we need to track him down.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_3
TEXT: We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders—and that’s where you come in, Trainer. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve been a huge help in our efforts to track down Giovanni. I’m happy to report that the team leaders and I have made significant headway in our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_4_1
TEXT: I’ve managed to finish building another Super Rocket Radar for you. You can use it to find and defeat Giovanni—and save that Legendary Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_0
TEXT: Fantastic work as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_1
TEXT: The fight against Team GO Rocket and their malicious machinations continues, but at least for today we can rest knowing that we’ve foiled their latest scheme.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_5_2
TEXT: So, until next time—let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you looked up at the sky lately? I thought I’d been staring at reports for too long, but no, there are rainbows everywhere!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_1
TEXT: That’s not all—I’ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pokémon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_2
TEXT: In all seriousness, why don’t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_3
TEXT: Keep your eye on the sky, and good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket’s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pokémon for themselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_1
TEXT: Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can’t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pokémon. It’s time to do some investigating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_2
TEXT: Knowing how large Team GO Rocket’s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pokémon in their wake. Let’s go catch some Shadow Pokémon and see where they lead us!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_0
TEXT: Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pokémon...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_1
TEXT: ...and that it’s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pokémon! But don’t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_2
TEXT: Let’s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh’s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_0
TEXT: Great job saving even more Shadow Pokémon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we’ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_1
TEXT: For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that’ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we’ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_1
TEXT: Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I’m certain you’ll come out on top—and save Ho-Oh to boot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_0
TEXT: What a magnificent battle, %PLAYERNAME%! Congrats on defeating Giovanni and saving Ho-Oh from his clutches.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_2
TEXT: With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pokémon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I’ll see you next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Glad you’re here. There’s something I could use your help with today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve been away for a while.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_2
TEXT: I’ve been thinking about how to shake off the doldrums. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks—Pokémon research! Specifically, I’d like to learn about Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_3
TEXT: Roggenrola were first discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure, but the dirt that makes up their bodies is even older!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_4
TEXT: A Pokémon made of earth is just the thing to get me feeling grounded again, don’t you think? Not that I need an excuse to study Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_5
TEXT: Could you unearth some Roggenrola for me, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_0
TEXT: Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! Let’s get a closer look at those Roggenrola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_1
TEXT: Hm... Did you notice the hexagonal cavities on their bodies? Those are their ears, and deep inside is an energy core that makes Roggenrola slightly warm to the touch.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_2
TEXT: But don’t stick your hand inside the cavity—that’s a surefire way to get on their bad side, and fast!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_3
TEXT: Is that from firsthand experience, you ask? W-well, any researcher worth his salt has to take the occasional risk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_4
TEXT: You know, when Roggenrola evolve into Boldore and their energy is too great to be contained, they grow orange crystals on their bodies hard enough to smash diamonds.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_5
TEXT: Doesn’t that sound like a sight, %PLAYERNAME%? Why don’t you help Roggenrola evolve so you can see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Boldore are looking great.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_1
TEXT: Their crystals—amazing! If only I had some diamonds to put that whole “smashing” thing to the proof.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_2
TEXT: Well, while we can’t conduct that particular experiment, I can still tell you more about Boldore.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_3
TEXT: Their crystals are actually masses of energy. Just one crystal fragment could provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_4
TEXT: *sigh* Yet another theory we can’t test ourselves. But if you help Boldore evolve, I’ll tell you all about what they do with that power, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_0
TEXT: There you have it, %PLAYERNAME%—a Gigalith of your own. Those crystals are even bigger now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_1
TEXT: When Gigalith’s orange crystals absorb solar energy, it’s magnified internally and fired from its mouth. It’s even capable of blowing away a mountain!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_2
TEXT: Because of its hefty horsepower, Gigalith is a popular partner for construction workers.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure you and Gigalith will get along great too, seeing as you’re always out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_4
TEXT: At any rate, thanks for helping me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m feeling more like my old self already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_5
TEXT: Let’s do this again soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_0
TEXT: Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_1
TEXT: I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_2
TEXT: Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_3
TEXT: Did you know you can judge a Roselia’s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you—those were VERY healthy Roselia!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_4
TEXT: But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_5
TEXT: The thorns on Roselia’s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_6
TEXT: It’s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_1
TEXT: While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_2
TEXT: When it comes to Pokémon, new discoveries are being made all the time—so it’s important to make sure your information is up to date.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_3
TEXT: Roselia, the Thorn Pokémon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pokémon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_4
TEXT: It’s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_5
TEXT: In reviewing these two Pokémon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_0
TEXT: As aromatic Pokémon go, we’re pretty fortunate it’s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_1
TEXT: A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_2
TEXT: Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn’t realize you were back.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_3
TEXT: I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_4
TEXT: According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_5
TEXT: Isn’t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you’ve been out doing research?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_6
TEXT: You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn’t put it past you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_7
TEXT: Now that you’re back, I’d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_8
TEXT: I’m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_0
TEXT: Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pokémon, Roserade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_1
TEXT: It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_2
TEXT: Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade’s hands is a different color?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_3
TEXT: Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_4
TEXT: What an amazing Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_5
TEXT: Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pokémon in the world around us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_6
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_0
TEXT: Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_1
TEXT: I’m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_2
TEXT: These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn’t fall.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_3
TEXT: Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_4
TEXT: How about you spend some time with them and see what they’re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I’d love to take a closer look at them—especially their shells.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_1
TEXT: Did you know that there’s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_2
TEXT: How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_3
TEXT: The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4
TEXT: When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_5
TEXT: It’s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_6
TEXT: I’d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let’s get back out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_0
TEXT: You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don’t they look like a tough bunch?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_1
TEXT: Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pokémon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_2
TEXT: On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_3
TEXT: But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_4
TEXT: They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_5
TEXT: Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight—befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_1
TEXT: Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_2
TEXT: The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_3
TEXT: Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_5
TEXT: I’ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_6
TEXT: And I’ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won’t be long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_7
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s good to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_1
TEXT: As you know, I’ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pokémon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_2
TEXT: One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pokémon from the Unova region—a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_3
TEXT: Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pokémon in my dreams!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_4
TEXT: Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pokémon—you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_5
TEXT: ...Get it? Sturdy? Because they’re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I’d appreciate the help. Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we’ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_1
TEXT: There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_2
TEXT: My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pokémon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we’re as prepared as possible!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_3
TEXT: This first story tells of a Legendary Pokémon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it’s been hailed as “The Guardian of the Fields.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_4
TEXT: Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven’t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I’ve read agrees on its existence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_5
TEXT: For now, why don’t we research Ground-type Pokémon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus’s Therian Forme when the time comes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_0
TEXT: Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we’ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_1
TEXT: And is that a Drilbur you’ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_2
TEXT: Anyway, since we’ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pokémon from my dream?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_3
TEXT: Let’s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_4
TEXT: Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pokémon in the area is our best bet for now? Let’s give it a shot, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_0
TEXT: Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it’s quacked up to be? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_1
TEXT: I think we’ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_2
TEXT: Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pokémon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_3
TEXT: You see, I’d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_4
TEXT: It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I’m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pokémon nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_5
TEXT: For now, though, let’s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pokémon detailed in those stories—Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6
TEXT: Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_7
TEXT: For the sake of consistency, let’s go ahead and research Electric-type Pokémon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_0
TEXT: Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_1
TEXT: But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_2
TEXT: I feel confident that when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pokémon—regardless of which forme they appear in.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_3
TEXT: Now—do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_4
TEXT: While consulting the Pokédex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pokémon called Munna. It’s known as the Dream Eater Pokémon—so you can see why it caught my eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_5
TEXT: Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pokémon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it’s a nightmare.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6
TEXT: I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pokémon again, so I suspect Munna’s mist was nice and rosy that day!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_7
TEXT: Munna seems like a fascinating Pokémon, and I can’t wait to research it more. I hope you’ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’m glad you’re here. A new adventure is about to begin!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1
TEXT: Not long ago, various Legendary Pokémon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pokémon, that was responsible.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2
TEXT: Hoopa’s rings allow it to teleport things—including itself—wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3
TEXT: How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4
TEXT: Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5
TEXT: Needless to say, I’m still not sure why Hoopa’s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I’m sure we’ll crack the case in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6
TEXT: For now, why don’t you try using an Incense to see what Pokémon you can find in the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_0
TEXT: ... ... ...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_1
TEXT: BOO! Haha, did I scare you? Not too badly, I hope.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_2
TEXT: Let’s continue our investigation into these eerie events. Don’t worry—I won’t send you into any rickety mansions or foggy forests.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_3
TEXT: I was actually doing some research near a forest myself recently, and I found a rather odd-looking tree. I’ve learned over the years to trust my gut when something seems strange in the field—chances are it’s a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_4
TEXT: I couldn’t help but indulge my curiosity, and I stepped toward the tree to observe it more closely. As soon as I did, the tree pivoted on its roots and stared me down with a single red eye!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5
TEXT: It didn’t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pokémon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_6
TEXT: It must have sensed that I was just there for research because it turned back around and ignored me. Its attention then turned to the many Phantump gathered around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_7
TEXT: That’s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pokémon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8
TEXT: Ghost-type Pokémon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you’ll find they’re full of surprises. I’m sure the same goes for Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_9
TEXT: I have a feeling there’s more to Hoopa than its penchant for mischief. Maybe we’ll find some answers after we conduct some more research on Ghost-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_11_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! As we close out our spooky investigations, I have a feeling there are some bright things on the horizon for us to explore together soon. I’ll be sure to let you know when I have something to share!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It’s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it’s up, though, so it’s a pretty fair trade!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1
TEXT: If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness—both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2
TEXT: What’s more, I can’t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3
TEXT: Pokémon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it’s a researcher’s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4
TEXT: For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We’ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5
TEXT: But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You’ve earned it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1
TEXT: It seems that Hoopa’s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2
TEXT: Why don’t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you’ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0
TEXT: I’m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1
TEXT: While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization’s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2
TEXT: I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3
TEXT: There’s no time to lose—we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4
TEXT: You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it’s still a Pokémon. It must be protected!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5
TEXT: We’ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pokémon into a Shadow Pokémon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we’ll need your help if we’re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pokémon, and keep Hoopa safe.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pokémon—and Hoopa, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1
TEXT: Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2
TEXT: We’ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa’s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0
TEXT: As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I’ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I’ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1
TEXT: You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2
TEXT: I’ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_1
TEXT: Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_2
TEXT: Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_3
TEXT: It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up—but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn’t all bad.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_4
TEXT: It was nice having an excuse to clean—not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_5
TEXT: Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn’t it? I think it’s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that’s why it’s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_6
TEXT: Who knows—you might be able to catch it now!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_1
TEXT: Normally I’d say we’re done with our research, but I wouldn’t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_2
TEXT: It seems there’s still much for us to learn about this Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_3
TEXT: By the way, I’ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pokémon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa’s presence be the cause?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_4
TEXT: Perhaps we’ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pokémon, including Hoopa. I’ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I’ll let you know when I’ve learned more. Until next time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pokémon appearing around my mobile lab of late.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_1
TEXT: Whenever something like this happens, I can’t help but get excited about researching the cause!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_2
TEXT: As you may recall, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pokémon in these parts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_3
TEXT: What’s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pokémon. There’s one in particular that’s caught my attention: Inkay.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_4
TEXT: My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pokémon, and that it evolves in a unique way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_5
TEXT: I’m ashamed to say I’ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying “upside-down” several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_6
TEXT: Maybe it’s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear “upside-down”—because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_0
TEXT: Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa’s brought some welcome color to our lives.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_1
TEXT: Speaking of colorful things, I’ve heard reports that there’s a certain Pokémon nearby that’s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won’t you?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_2
TEXT: In the meantime, I’m going to analyze everything we’ve learned about Psychic-type Pokémon thus far. Hopefully it’ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pokémon forms—and Hoopa!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve noticed that some Pokémon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn’t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_1
TEXT: Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pokémon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat—10 in all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_2
TEXT: Why don’t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows—maybe we’ll learn more about other Pokémon along the way!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_0
TEXT: Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pokémon that’re known to change their appearance? That includes one we’ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_1
TEXT: Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_2
TEXT: I wonder if we’ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_3
TEXT: In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We’re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can’t rule out Hoopa’s involvement.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_4
TEXT: Hoopa’s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it’ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_5
TEXT: I’ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s nice to see a friendly face—because I’ve been seeing a lot of spooky Pokémon staring at me lately!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_1
TEXT: Do you think this might be Hoopa’s doing? Hoopa’s known to transport Pokémon and people to different places with its rings, so maybe that’s what’s happening here.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_2
TEXT: After all those Legendary Pokémon appeared during this year’s GO Fest—as well as those Pokémon first found in Galar that appeared more recently—I’d say Hoopa’s involvement here is more than likely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_3
TEXT: Perhaps we can learn more about Hoopa by studying the Ghost-type Pokémon that have begun to show up nearby. Mind giving me a hand, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_0
TEXT: Thanks for conducting that research, Trainer. We certainly know more than we did, but not enough to explain why these spooky occurrences are still...well, occurring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_1
TEXT: Let’s do a bit more research on Ghost-type Pokémon then, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you and Rhi enough for bringing me back from beyond the Ultra Wormhole. The two of you are quite the team!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_2
TEXT: As exhilarating as it was to explore a different dimension, it wasn’t without its challenges. Thoughts of home kept me calm—you, Meltan, the team leaders...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_3
TEXT: Maybe it was the sheer strength of those memories, but more than once it seemed almost like I was being surrounded by a protective presence—warm like the sun and calm like the moon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_4
TEXT: Who knows—maybe there really was something watching out for me! Our world can’t be the only one full of mysteries, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_5
TEXT: Speaking of mysteries, I have a new one to share with you, %PLAYERNAME%. Since my return, a small, gaseous Pokémon I’ve never seen before has been hanging around my lab.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_6
TEXT: It seems friendly, but where did it come from?  Did it follow me from beyond the Ultra Wormhole? Could it be an Ultra Beast?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_7
TEXT: Considering that possibility, I think it would be best if you work with Rhi to raise this Pokémon. Naturally, I’ll be eager to hear anything you may learn in the process.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. With the Ultra Beasts presently at bay, now is an opportune moment to reflect on our time together thus far.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_1
TEXT: The Ultra Wormholes and the dangers they pose were my primary concerns upon arriving in this world. But now, I find myself equally invested in developing our relationship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_2
TEXT: In light of our new rapport, perhaps it is time I reintroduced myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_3
TEXT: I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad. It is a pleasure to be your friend, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_4
TEXT: Is there any objective I may assist you with today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_5
TEXT: Your Professor Willow has asked us to rear and study a peculiar Pokémon, is it? Understood.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_6
TEXT: Ah. I have heard tales of such a Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_7
TEXT: Its gentle glow is impossible to mistake. I believe this Pokémon is called...Cosmog.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_8
TEXT: Come—let us show Cosmog the beauty of this world.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_0
TEXT: Hm? You wish to know more of Cosmog?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_1
TEXT: Some have said that in ages past, it was known as the child of the stars.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_2
TEXT: Beyond that, few details are known.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_3
TEXT: Perhaps you and I can shed some light on this peculiar Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_4
TEXT: Earning its trust seems like a logical first step.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_5
TEXT: Do you think Cosmog would feel closer to us if it were given a nickname?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_6
TEXT: Its visage reminds me of outer space... A nebula, perhaps.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_7
TEXT: But never mind my musings. I will leave the decision to you, %PLAYERNAME%.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_8
TEXT: No matter the name, I am eager to learn more of Cosmog as we become better acquainted.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you, as always. 

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_1
TEXT: How have you and Rhi been? Have you two learned any more about that mysterious Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_2
TEXT: Rhi recognizes it, you say? And its name is Cosmog? Incredible! Having a bit of extra-dimensional help really expands our knowledge base.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_3
TEXT: Still, when it comes to Pokémon research, nothing beats firsthand observation. Have you gleaned anything interesting during your time with Cosmog, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_4
TEXT: Hmm... I see.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_5
TEXT: Sounds like Cosmog’s curious, but not very cautious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_6
TEXT: I can relate to throwing caution to the wind, but when you’re light enough to be blown away by the slightest breeze... Well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_7
TEXT: It’s a good thing you and Rhi are there to make sure Cosmog is safe—just like you were for me!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_8
TEXT: Anyhow, the more time you spend with Cosmog, the more we’ll learn. Let me know when you make more discoveries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%. Greetings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_1
TEXT: So, Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_2
TEXT: Do not be troubled by its current state.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_3
TEXT: This is its natural biology at work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_4
TEXT: Though Cosmoem lies inert, energy is building within its core.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_5
TEXT: I suspect it is preparing to evolve and will become active again in due time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_6
TEXT: Precisely when that will happen is beyond my knowledge, however.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_7
TEXT: Once Cosmoem evolves, I wonder... Wait. I am struck by a thought. Recall how Willow spoke of a presence “warm like the sun and calm like the moon.”

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_8
TEXT: I apologize for the abrupt interruption of our conversation, %PLAYERNAME%, but I must make some notes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_9
TEXT: Please continue your exploration in my absence and apprise Professor Willow of Cosmog’s evolution into Cosmoem.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back already! How’s Cosmog—

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_1
TEXT: Whoa! Who’s that Pokémon? Did Cosmog evolve?! Just look at that lustrous shell!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_2
TEXT: Rhi’s hypothesis is that this “Cosmoem” will stay in this state until it’s ready to evolve? Excellent theory!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_3
TEXT: It’s definitely easier to get an up-close look at a Pokémon holding still, but what do you think is going on in Cosmoem’s mind? Is it asleep? Maybe it’s dreaming of adventuring with you and Rhi!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_4
TEXT: What else will we learn once it “becomes active,” as Rhi put it? What kind of Pokémon could it become? Unlike our serene friend here, my mind’s buzzing with questions and possibilities!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_5
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what mysteries we’ll unravel, %PLAYERNAME%! Keep taking good care of Cosmoem until then.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_season8_6_0
TEXT: Still in a holding pattern with Cosmoem, %PLAYERNAME%? Not to worry—sometimes slow and steady is the way to go. I’ll be waiting right here, so come see me when you have an update to share.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_0
TEXT: Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you’ve been well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1
TEXT: The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park—but by the time I’d run over, the area was empty and dark.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2
TEXT: I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pokémon, but I can’t be sure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3
TEXT: How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pokémon are still nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0
TEXT: Well, would you look at that! It’s Shinx, the Flash Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1
TEXT: Considering all I’ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2
TEXT: Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3
TEXT: Last night’s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4
TEXT: Now that you’ve caught a Shinx, why don’t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5
TEXT: Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio’s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let’s learn more about it, shall we?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0
TEXT: Well done, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve got yourself a Luxio!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1
TEXT: Also known as the Spark Pokémon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio’s electricity by joining their tails together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2
TEXT: So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3
TEXT: I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pokémon’s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0
TEXT: Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pokémon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey—even through thick walls.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1
TEXT: But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2
TEXT: What an electrifying revelation! We’ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there’s still much to discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3
TEXT: Despite all that hard work, it seems you’ve still got a little spark left in you—so why don’t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1
TEXT: I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It’s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2
TEXT: But that’s not the only thing that’s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4
TEXT: I don’t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pokémon. Could you lend me a hand?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5
TEXT: They’re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn’t have much trouble observing them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6
TEXT: Good luck out there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1
TEXT: I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2
TEXT: These Grass-type Pokémon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3
TEXT: They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4
TEXT: While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I’d like to document its Evolution, Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5
TEXT: Take care when you do, however—Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That’s a mighty fine Servine.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1
TEXT: Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pokémon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it’s far from sluggish, it won’t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2
TEXT: Now that we’ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I’d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy’s final Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3
TEXT: Serperior is known as the Regal Pokémon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4
TEXT: Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It’ll be a great boon to my research, and you’ll have a powerful Grass-type Pokémon to join your journey as well!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1
TEXT: It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents’ movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2
TEXT: Having a Pokémon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I’d say!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I’ll take one more walk before the day’s done—can’t let weather like this go to waste!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4
TEXT: Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It’s great to see you again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1
TEXT: I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today—a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2
TEXT: Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3
TEXT: When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4
TEXT: They’re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I’ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren’t they just the roundest?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1
TEXT: According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2
TEXT: In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don’t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer—and hello there, Sealeo!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1
TEXT: I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2
TEXT: Well, it looks like something’s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pokémon could have caused this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3
TEXT: My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4
TEXT: Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0
TEXT: You did it, Trainer! Walrein’s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren’t they?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1
TEXT: Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd’s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2
TEXT: Nice to know they can look after themselves—though considering those tusks, I don’t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_3
TEXT: I’m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_4
TEXT: Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I’ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0
TEXT: Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You’ve dropped by just in time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1
TEXT: As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2
TEXT: Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3
TEXT: When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4
TEXT: I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pokémon, and I think there’s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pokémon that is bound to a strange stone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1
TEXT: I can’t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pokémon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pokémon, it will appear?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0
TEXT: Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we’ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1
TEXT: I can’t tell if it’s the weather, but I’ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2
TEXT: I'll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1
TEXT: It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I’m pretty sure it did that on purpose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2
TEXT: It’s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pokémon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3
TEXT: Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1
TEXT: Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it’s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2
TEXT: Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3
TEXT: Why don’t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it’ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0
TEXT: On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pokémon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1
TEXT: Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2
TEXT: I’m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3
TEXT: Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I’ve been startled enough for one day of research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0
TEXT: So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pokémon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1
TEXT: Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That’s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2
TEXT: I’d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned—stay up-to-date with Pokémon, even familiar ones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3
TEXT: Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I’ll be in touch about our next research adventure!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have arrived at a convenient time. I would like you to assist me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_1
TEXT: I am only beginning to grow familiar with the sounds of this world. The rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_2
TEXT: But today I hear a new—there!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_3
TEXT: That high-pitched chattering and stirring of air. Is it some sort of natural phenomenon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_4
TEXT: So you believe it to be caused by Pokémon. Intriguing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_5
TEXT: I am eager to locate the source. Let us proceed.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_0
TEXT: So the multitude of Starly are the source of this cacophony.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_1
TEXT: Though diminutive, they flap their wings with great power. And when they form a flock...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_2
TEXT: I would not wish to be the target of their displeasure.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_3
TEXT: The strength of such a small creature is a marvel.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_4
TEXT: And if it were to evolve, I suspect that strength would only grow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_5
TEXT: Evolution affects Pokémon in such splendid ways. How will Starly change, do you think? Not another head, surely?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_6
TEXT: After our experience with Deino, little would surprise me. Nevertheless, I would like to witness this transformation for myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_0
TEXT: I am impressed yet again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_1
TEXT: Staravia might not have grown an additional head, but it did increase in size.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_2
TEXT: My early observations indicate that Staravia, too, prefer to travel in a flock.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_3
TEXT: And when Staravia are not surrounded by their kind, they cry noisily. Perhaps they find comfort and security when together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_4
TEXT: I...can understand this.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_5
TEXT: Ahem. Does it evolve further? What changes might that bring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_0
TEXT: Stunning. What a formidable physique.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_1
TEXT: This musculature of this Pokémon—Staraptor, is it?—indicates great strength. It appears more than capable of carrying away its prey.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_2
TEXT: And, unlike Starly and Staravia, it appears not to travel in flocks. Curious.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_3
TEXT: The Pokémon of this world have such fascinating social structures. Some are more comfortable with others, and some find contentment alone.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_4
TEXT: They are like humans in this way, do you not think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_5
TEXT: With each investigation we undertake, my understanding of your world is further illuminated.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_6
TEXT: Thank you for your company, Pokémon Trainer. Until again.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0
TEXT: *yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You’ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1
TEXT: Maybe it’d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pokémon to hug... Like Stufful!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2
TEXT: Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I’ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3
TEXT: I wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to snuggle one—for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, you’re back! And you’ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1
TEXT: Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pokémon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2
TEXT: For both our sakes, maybe we’d better befriend it before we try to cuddle—I mean, continue our research, don’t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0
TEXT: Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution—Bewear—has the habit of hugging its companions?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1
TEXT: Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2
TEXT: Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3
TEXT: While I don’t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn’t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don’t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0
TEXT: What a strong-looking Bewear you’ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1
TEXT: What’s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could’ve mistaken me for a bird Pokémon. Haha—ow...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2
TEXT: On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pokémon moves who’d love to hear all about this...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3
TEXT: I hope you’ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I’m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I’ll be in touch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0
TEXT: Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1
TEXT: I’d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I’ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2
TEXT: Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping—yes, like birds!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3
TEXT: The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pokémon was involved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4
TEXT: Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1
TEXT: Ah—Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pokémon. Hmm... It’s all beginning to make sense.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2
TEXT: Swablu’s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3
TEXT: At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4
TEXT: Swablu apparently love to sit on people’s heads. They look like fluffy hats!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5
TEXT: Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6
TEXT: Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7
TEXT: A fascinating Pokémon through and through, don’t you think?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8
TEXT: Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you—it’s well worth it! I’m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9
TEXT: I’d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0
TEXT: Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you’ve been hard at work catching Swablu.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1
TEXT: Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn’t it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2
TEXT: Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3
TEXT: As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4
TEXT: All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5
TEXT: Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1
TEXT: Swablu’s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2
TEXT: It’s known to wrap its wings around the people it’s bonded with—much like yours is doing with you now.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3
TEXT: And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria’s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it’s not hard to see why.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4
TEXT: Between Altaria’s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I’m feeling quite moved!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5
TEXT: You truly are an incredible Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6
TEXT: Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll never get tired of learning more about Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0
TEXT: Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can’t help but be impressed by your progress. You’ve done fantastic work in researching Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched Pokémon that were found in those regions...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2
TEXT: let’s take a closer look at Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3
TEXT: I think it’s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pokémon from all over the world, there’s always more to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4
TEXT: Speaking of discoveries, I’ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5
TEXT: I was speaking to a researcher who’s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6
TEXT: It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7
TEXT: Maybe I could get a few workout tips—I’ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8
TEXT: Anyway...let’s do some more research on Pokémon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0
TEXT: Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pokémon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1
TEXT: These first-partner Pokémon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2
TEXT: This Sea Otter Pokémon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn’t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0
TEXT: I can’t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You’re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pokémon of many Trainers from Unova, let’s shift focus to the Fire-type one—Tepig!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2
TEXT: I’m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It’s such a clever use of a skill.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3
TEXT: I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0
TEXT: Being the savvy Trainer you are, I’m sure you know which type of Pokémon we’re going to research next.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1
TEXT: That’s right—Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pokémon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2
TEXT: Perhaps there’s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3
TEXT: Anyway, let’s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0
TEXT: You’re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I’m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1
TEXT: I can’t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2
TEXT: By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pokémon I’ve never encountered before.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3
TEXT: I think you’re the perfect Trainer to take this Pokémon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I’ll be in touch soon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1
TEXT: I was just thinking that it’d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pokémon and the team leaders’ buddies.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_2
TEXT: The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_3
TEXT: My buddy is the Mythical Pokémon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I’ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me—there’s a lot to learn!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_4
TEXT: I’ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you’ll run into one on your adventures?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_5
TEXT: Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let’s stock up on some supplies!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you’re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don’t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_1
TEXT: Known as the Transport Pokémon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pokémon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_2
TEXT: Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_3
TEXT: That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_4
TEXT: Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_5
TEXT: At any rate, let’s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pokémon to learn more about the Pokémon that Blanche holds dear.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0
TEXT: Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_1
TEXT: Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pokémon. Now, let’s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_2
TEXT: The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pokémon that hatch from Eggs, so it’s only natural that he’d have a buddy like Elekid.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_3
TEXT: But don’t let this Pokémon’s small stature fool you! Spark’s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_4
TEXT: Why hasn’t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_5
TEXT: I’m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_6
TEXT: Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pokémon than him.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_7
TEXT: What do you say we research some Electric-type Pokémon that Spark tends to work with?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_0
TEXT: How did your research go, Trainer? I think it’s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pokémon—specifically the Fire Horse Pokémon Rapidash.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_1
TEXT: This Pokémon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_2
TEXT: Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_3
TEXT: Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pokémon has plenty of time and space to do just that.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_4
TEXT: That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_5
TEXT: Candela’s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members—and everyone, really.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_6
TEXT: Maybe researching Fire-type Pokémon will help you learn more about Candela’s fiery spirit?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_1
TEXT: Now that we’ve learned more about the Pokémon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it’s time to do some research on my Buddy Pokémon: Meltan.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_2
TEXT: I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I’d never seen a Pokémon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_3
TEXT: The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we’ve been together ever since!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_4
TEXT: At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we’re practically inseparable.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_5
TEXT: Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me—we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_6
TEXT: Let’s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_0
TEXT: Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_1
TEXT: I’m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_2
TEXT: Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_3
TEXT: But I’m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pokémon—whether it be Meltan or any other Pokémon that you feel a special bond with.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_4
TEXT: After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pokémon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_5
TEXT: I’ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pokémon will achieve some incredible things—and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_6
TEXT: Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_0
TEXT: Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you again!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_1
TEXT: You know, I thought I smelled something sweet in the air today.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_2
TEXT: Did I spill Berry juice again, you ask? You wound me, %PLAYERNAME%! As if I’d ruin this snazzy new jacket!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_3
TEXT: Heh. In all seriousness, the smell was coming from outside.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_4
TEXT: Unfortunately, I didn’t have a chance to track down the source of the scent. But now that you’re here, maybe you can sniff it out!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Seeing as you’ve got Teddiursa with you, I think I can connect the dots on what I was smelling earlier—honey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_1
TEXT: Teddiursa likes to lick its palms after soaking them in honey, so it’s no wonder I caught a whiff.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_2
TEXT: That reminds me of a fun fact about Teddiursa’s Evolution, Ursaring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_3
TEXT: With its ability to distinguish any aroma, Ursaring unfailingly finds all food buried deep underground. If only it was that easy for me to find lunch!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_4
TEXT: Why don’t you help Teddiursa evolve so you can see Ursaring’s sleuthing skills for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_0
TEXT: I thought I heard something stomping about, and here you are, Ursaring in tow!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_1
TEXT: Here’s the thing about Ursaring—although it has a large body, it’s quite skilled at climbing trees. It eats and sleeps in the treetops.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_2
TEXT: Ah, to be an Ursaring... Imagine how much easier that’d make fieldwork—or picking Pinap Berries!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_3
TEXT: Ahem. Snacks aside, have you noticed there’s a full moon out early today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_4
TEXT: Looks like Ursaring is staring at it, too. Think you can find out why, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_0
TEXT: Whoa! Could that be—Ursaluna?!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_1
TEXT: I’ve never seen one in these parts. What an incredible find! Hmm...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_2
TEXT: Maybe in the Hisui region of long ago, where Ursaluna was first discovered, the full moon played a part in how Ursaring evolved.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_3
TEXT: It’s theorized that Hisui's swampy terrain gave Ursaluna its burly physique and ability to manipulate peat at will.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_4
TEXT: What kind of food would suit a Pokémon accustomed to living in swamps? Grains? Beans? Cake?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_5
TEXT: Maybe I should get baking for some firsthand taste-testing. I bet Teddiursa could lend me some honey!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_6
TEXT: Ah—listen to me yammering on and on. Researching Pokémon first found in Hisui never fails to pique my curiosity about the past!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_7
TEXT: Thanks again for spending the day learning about Pokémon with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I can always count on you to make my work a little sweeter!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do you have anything fun planned for today?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_1
TEXT: I’ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_2
TEXT: I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela’s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_3
TEXT: Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_4
TEXT: And suddenly—inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_5
TEXT: The Fire Pig Pokémon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_6
TEXT: Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don’t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don’t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_1
TEXT: Ah, I see you’ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_2
TEXT: Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_3
TEXT: When Pignite’s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_4
TEXT: Oh! That reminds me—I need to check on my roasted Berries.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_5
TEXT: While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don’t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_0
TEXT: Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_1
TEXT: Just when I thought Pokémon couldn’t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_2
TEXT: Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pokémon called Emboar.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_3
TEXT: Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It’s also known to care deeply about its friends.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_4
TEXT: Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I’ll be on my way soon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_5
TEXT: How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I’d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_0
TEXT: Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_1
TEXT: This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pokémon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_2
TEXT: According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_3
TEXT: And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_4
TEXT: Haha, only joking! I’m sure I’d find it far too itchy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_5
TEXT: Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_6
TEXT: Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It’s always a joy to see how much you’ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_7
TEXT: I’ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows—maybe even some recipes!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_8
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_1
TEXT: Your timing is excellent. I’ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_2
TEXT: You see, I’m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I’ve yet to suss out why they’ve been appearing.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_3
TEXT: I can only hope they’re not angry with us—or worse!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_4
TEXT: I think I’ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It’s important to give your brain a breather now and then!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_5
TEXT: Why don’t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you’ve found some leafy Pokémon to rest under.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_1
TEXT: Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_2
TEXT: While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_3
TEXT: As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We’ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_4
TEXT: Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5
TEXT: Let’s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula’Ula Island.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_6
TEXT: Ula’Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_7
TEXT: Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn’t be too hard to find!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_8
TEXT: In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we’ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pokémon that are known to grow. Let’s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%—you’re back. How did your search go?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_1
TEXT: I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_2
TEXT: And just a few minutes later, before I’d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she’d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_3
TEXT: Yet another guardian deity I’ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pokémon research, I suppose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_4
TEXT: I’m glad you’ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it’s out there, let’s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_5
TEXT: I’ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%—you saw Tapu Bulu, didn’t you!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_1
TEXT: What was it like? Tell me everything! Did you hear a ringing noise? Did you see it making vegetation grow, or maybe even swinging large trees around by their roots?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_2
TEXT: Those are all things Tapu Bulu is known for, you know.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_3
TEXT: As you might’ve expected, I was—yet again—unable to witness Tapu Bulu myself. I did, however, think up a new theory.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_4
TEXT: The guardian deities seem to be keeping a relatively low profile. Perhaps they’re just here to investigate something—or even help us somehow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_5
TEXT: Things may become clearer if we see Tapu Fini, the last of Alola’s guardian deities.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_6
TEXT: For now, though, I think we’ve earned some rest. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0
TEXT: Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1
TEXT: Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pokémon. I guess you could say we’re in a...hairy situation!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2
TEXT: ...Uh, moving along...

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3
TEXT: Weedle’s horn measures about two inches. It’s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4
TEXT: Let’s investigate Weedle further—but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn’t want to get poked by one.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0
TEXT: Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research—Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1
TEXT: It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and—in my opinion—honkable nose.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2
TEXT: I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don’t think to offer me any.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3
TEXT: Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle’s Evolution. I can’t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0
TEXT: Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pokémon didn’t move much, but wow.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1
TEXT: Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it’s doing nothing, it’s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2
TEXT: And that’s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn’t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we’ve learned so much about what’s happening to Kakuna!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3
TEXT: Let’s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it’s been working on.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0
TEXT: Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1
TEXT: Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pokémon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2
TEXT: This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pokémon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3
TEXT: Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I’ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn’t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab’s tires!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1
TEXT: I came to study Pokémon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pokémon I’ve observed today don’t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2
TEXT: Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pokémon around, it almost feels like a safari!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_1
TEXT: The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pokémon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0
TEXT: What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or—?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1
TEXT: Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pokémon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2
TEXT: Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3
TEXT: Zigzagoon’s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4
TEXT: Can you explain this?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5
TEXT: I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6
TEXT: So a single Pokémon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7
TEXT: I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0
TEXT: How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1
TEXT: I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness—but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2
TEXT: Fret not, Pokémon Trainer—no people or Pokémon were harmed during my experiment.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3
TEXT: I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon’s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1
TEXT: I have concluded that Galarian Linoone’s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon’s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2
TEXT: Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3
TEXT: They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4
TEXT: I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pokémon interact with each other.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5
TEXT: Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0
TEXT: Greetings, Pokémon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1
TEXT: Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2
TEXT: What’s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3
TEXT: My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4
TEXT: I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5
TEXT: How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_0
TEXT: Amazing! You found some rare Pokémon that were first discovered in the Sinnoh region already? And is that...a Shiny Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_1
TEXT: Amazing! I’ve never seen an Eevee like that before! Shiny Pokémon have a rare and distinct coloration that sets them apart from others of their species!

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_4_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_summer_return_5_0

RESOURCE ID: sierra_challenge#10

RESOURCE ID: sierra_challenge#2

RESOURCE ID: sierra_challenge#3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_0
TEXT: I was thinking: Because we don’t know what attracted Shaymin here, we should make sure the surrounding area is safe.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: I really hope Shaymin hasn’t found itself in any trouble!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_2_2
TEXT: Before we start, though, why don’t you power up some of your Pokémon in case we need to defend Shaymin when we find it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! We’re off to a great start already.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_1
TEXT: I have another research-related question for you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: How intensely do you think we’ll need to focus our efforts today?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: That sounds good to me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_4
TEXT: Something else just occurred to me. Do you think Team GO Rocket will try to capture Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_5
TEXT: The thought of something happening to that sweet little Pokémon is almost too much to bear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_3_6
TEXT: Well, now that your team’s powered up, we can stop Team GO Rocket before they even get started. Let’s get out there and scare them off, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back! Thanks for taking care of those Team GO Rocket members.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Now that the area’s safe, we can really focus on our search for Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: After meeting with the team leaders, I’ve learned that Shaymin sightings are happening around the world! Since we can’t be everywhere all at once, let’s start the search right here, where we are.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_4
TEXT: The team leaders are a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_5
TEXT: My current theory is that Shaymin will appear wherever Trainers are feeling thankful. With that in mind, why don’t you and your Buddy Pokémon try challenging a raid?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_4_6
TEXT: Perhaps Shaymin will sense the gratitude you feel for your Pokémon and the other Trainers battling at your side.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_1
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if we got everything on the first try?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_2
TEXT: I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new intel. In the meantime, let’s think of other ways we can encourage Shaymin to appear.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_battle_narrative_section_5_3
TEXT: What if you try battling some other Trainers? Perhaps Shaymin will sense the bonds of gratitude between you and your Pokémon team. Give it a try, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_0
TEXT: Before we get started, let’s take a moment to appreciate our Pokémon pals.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: It’s always exciting to meet new Pokémon, but it’s important to make time for the ones that have supported us all along. After all, we’d be lost without them!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_2
TEXT: Much like I’d be lost without your unwavering support. Thanks as always, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_2_3
TEXT: Now, why don’t you spend some time with your Buddy Pokémon?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_0
TEXT: And I hope you had a pleasant time with your Buddy Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_2
TEXT: Hm? You didn’t know the team leaders were assisting us? But of course! They’re a curious bunch, and dutiful, too. They’re more than happy to help investigate the mysteries of Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_3_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin is out getting to know the nearby Pokémon. Try catching a few and see if you can spot Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_1
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d it go?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: No sign of Shaymin yet, eh? Well, that’s understandable. Mythical Pokémon aren’t known to be easy to find, after all!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: I appreciate you entertaining my hypothesis, though. Perhaps we can try luring Shaymin out with some Pinap Berries next? That would certainly work for me... Haha!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_0
TEXT: Welcome back! No Shaymin yet, eh? Not to worry. What fun would life be if everything came easily?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_1
TEXT: I’ll check in with the team leaders to see if they have any new info.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_catch_narrative_section_5_2
TEXT: While we gather more intel, why don’t you head back out and see what Pokémon you can find?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_0
TEXT: I’m sure you’re raring to go, but let’s take a moment to think about the friends who’ve helped you on your journey thus far.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_1
TEXT: Why don’t you send them some Gifts to let them know you’re thinking about them? It’s a great way to show your appreciation!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_2_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_0
TEXT: How’d it go, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_2
TEXT: Hmm... Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, so perhaps we can attract it to us by expressing gratitude.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_4_3
TEXT: It’s just a theory, but maybe hatching an Egg would help? It can’t hurt to try!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_explore_narrative_section_5_2

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_find_shaymin_narrative_section_1

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_find_shaymin_narrative_section_2
TEXT: But unfortunately, I’ve also heard that Team GO Rocket is sneaking around as well. Needless to say, we’ll have to clear them out before they can harm Shaymin.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_find_shaymin_narrative_section_3

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_0
TEXT: Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome to Pokémon GO Fest 2022.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: This year’s festivities are already off to an incredible start—I’m receiving reports that the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin has been sighted nearby!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: The flowers on Shaymin’s body are said to burst into bloom when Shaymin is lovingly hugged and senses gratitude. Believe me, it’s not every day you see Shaymin around!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I wonder if Shaymin’s appearance is somehow related to the island guardians...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: Or... What if Shaymin’s appeared in response to how thankful I am for all your help lately! Shaymin is known as the Gratitude Pokémon, after all.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: I’m also thankful that you’re here today to enjoy the celebrations. You’ve more than earned it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: I’m sure you’re eager to start searching for Shaymin, so I won’t keep you. Something tells me it’s going to be an exciting day!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_intro_narrative_section_7
TEXT: Now, let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_0
TEXT: Splendid, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve brought back Shaymin!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_1
TEXT: Once you’re better friends, I hope you’ll hug it so we can see its flowers burst into bloom!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_2
TEXT: As always, thanks for helping me with today’s research! Your contributions are truly invaluable.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_3
TEXT: I’d like to give you a hug myself—but I spilled some Pinap Juice on myself earlier, so I think I’ll keep my stickiness to myself.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_4
TEXT: I want to hear all about how you found Shaymin, but first—have you noticed what’s appeared in the sky?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_5
TEXT: Those gaping anomalies appear reminiscent of Hoopa’s rings, but also quite different. A bit like...black holes, perhaps? No—wormholes? What could be on the other side, I wonder? Is this why Alola’s island guardians have been appearing?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_6
TEXT: My mind is buzzing with all the possibilities! Though, I think we should tackle this tomorrow. Today’s been plenty exciting.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_7
TEXT: I can’t wait to see what tomorrow holds.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_8
TEXT: And I’m certain that whatever it is, we’ll face it together!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_outro_narrative_section_9

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_0
TEXT: Hello! Looks like you’re already all warmed up.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_1
TEXT: Before we continue, I’d like your opinion on something very important.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_2
TEXT: What’s your preferred method of searching for Shaymin?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d1_pre_choice_narrative_section_3
TEXT: Great choice, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_0
TEXT: Ah—hello.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_1
TEXT: Or, hmm... Would “what is up” be an acceptable greeting in this circumstance? I have been told the humans of this world are fond of such parlance.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_10
TEXT: This world is mysterious. Would you assist me in expanding my knowledge of it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_11
TEXT: Thank you. I am fortunate to have found someone so kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_12
TEXT: Tell me all about your world, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_13
TEXT: Together, perhaps we can expose why the Ultra Wormholes have materialized in your world and mitigate the anomalies that result.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_2
TEXT: It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_3
TEXT: You are a...Pokémon Trainer, is it? I am familiar with the concept.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_4
TEXT: I apologize if I appear awkward. You are the first human I’ve met in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_5
TEXT: Do you see that hole in the sky? That is called an Ultra Wormhole, a tear in space that leads to a world very different from yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_6
TEXT: In fact, I’ve traveled through that wormhole myself, in order to research its appearance and assist with any resulting anomalies occurring in your world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_7
TEXT: Hm? You have a concern?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_8
TEXT: I see. This “Professor Willow” failed to appear before you, is it? I’m unfamiliar with any such individual, but I understand the concern that arises when a companion is missing.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_1_9
TEXT: I will assist you in your search. In return, however, I would ask a favor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_0
TEXT: Wah tee sup, Pokémon Trainer? Hmm... That feels incorrect.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_1
TEXT: Thank you for your assistance thus far. Shall we turn our attention to other objectives?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_10
TEXT: Until again, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_2
TEXT: First, we must find out what caused the Ultra Wormholes to appear in this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_3
TEXT: Second, we must keep watch for anything that may travel through them.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_4
TEXT: And third, we must find your missing Willow friend.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_5
TEXT: But before all of that, a question: what are those large, towering structures spread throughout the area? They seem to sometimes be blue or red or yellow, and they’re far larger than what you said are “PokéStops.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_6
TEXT: “Gyms,” is it? And Pokémon Trainers gather there to challenge powerful Pokémon in “Raid Battles”? Fascinating.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_7
TEXT: Tell me everything you know about these Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_8
TEXT: They seem to serve as nexus between powerful creatures and humans.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_2_9
TEXT: If it is acceptable to you, I would like to start by focusing our efforts there.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_0
TEXT: Thank you for shining a light on the concept of Raid Battles, Pokémon Trainer. In return, I will confide in you what I know about the Ultra Wormholes.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_1
TEXT: Ultra Wormholes are portals into Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_10
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_11
TEXT: If that person was the Willow professor you’re searching for, the GO Ultra Recon Squad will no doubt come to their aid. Such is our purpose.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_12
TEXT: In the between time, I will remain here to provide assistance and illuminate any truths I can.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_13
TEXT: Let us continue to help each other, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_2
TEXT: These dimensional passageways allow creatures known as Ultra Beasts to spill into worlds they don’t belong—and they are fiercely strong.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_3
TEXT: Ultra Beasts are similar to the creatures you call Pokémon—but to your eyes, I imagine they might appear...somewhat different than what you’re accustomed.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_4
TEXT: As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_5
TEXT: The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_6
TEXT: It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pokémon.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_7
TEXT: I’d like to subdue it before it causes trouble for anyone in this world. Can I beg your help in this undertaking?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_8
TEXT: I have no experience in Pokémon battles. Where I come from, Pokémon are shared.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_9
TEXT: Furthermore, there are indications that someone from this world was sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. If that is true, that person could be in tremendous danger.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_0
TEXT: To what are you up, Pokémon Trainer? That...that’s not it, is it? *sigh* I see you have caught many Ground-type Pokémon. May I ask why?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_1
TEXT: They’re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pokémon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_2
TEXT: I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_3
TEXT: We can tell each other more about our worlds as we go.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_4
TEXT: I am once again thankful to have acquainted myself with someone so cordial.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_5
TEXT: There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_6
TEXT: Come, Pokémon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_0
TEXT: A question, Pokémon Trainer—who are those people with the large red Rs on their clothes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_1
TEXT: Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they’re friends of yours.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_2
TEXT: Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_3
TEXT: Their presence unnerves me.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_4
TEXT: If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_0
TEXT: Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pokémon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_1
TEXT: May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_2
TEXT: Hm? Ultra Beasts aren’t the only creatures you’ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_3
TEXT: I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_4
TEXT: The Alola region... I’ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven’t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_0
TEXT: Shall we pause, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_1
TEXT: This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize—I’ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_2
TEXT: How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_3
TEXT: I see... Spending time with your Pokémon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_4
TEXT: I am enchanted by these “Incubators” that you place Eggs within.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_5
TEXT: They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_6
TEXT: Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_7
TEXT: Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you—but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_8
TEXT: To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Poké Ball...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_0
TEXT: You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_1
TEXT: You seem unafraid of the unknown. It’s an admirable trait.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_2
TEXT: Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_3
TEXT: I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pokémon Trainer.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_4
TEXT: In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures—and not easily controlled.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_5
TEXT: Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_6
TEXT: And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pokémon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_7
TEXT: A “snapshot,” is it? What a delight.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_8
TEXT: Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_0
TEXT: Your world is almost blindingly bright—and more verdant than I’ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_1
TEXT: Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_10
TEXT: Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pokémon Trainer?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_11
TEXT: Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_12
TEXT: You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be—

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_13
TEXT: Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pokémon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_2
TEXT: Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world’s new dilemma.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_3
TEXT: And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There’s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_4
TEXT: But worry not, Pokémon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors—it is only fair.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_5
TEXT: If this man is anything like you’ve described, I have no doubt he’ll be well in the end.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_6
TEXT: So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return—but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_7
TEXT: For now, I’ll see what else I can do to assist you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_8

TEXT: Hopefully we can get some insight into what they’ve been up to since they smashed open that mysterious door...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: You know what your adventure needs, %PLAYERNAME%? A new buddy! I spoke with a colleague and was able to orchestrate a little surprise for you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: These Pokémon are the first partner Pokémon offered to Trainers in the Johto region. Go on—pick one!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: I think that’s a great Pokémon, too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_chikorita
TEXT: Chikorita, the Leaf Pokémon, is docile and loves to soak up the sun’s rays. A sweet aroma gently wafts from the leaf on its head. Doesn’t it have just the most adorable face?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_cyndaquil
TEXT: Cyndaquil, the Fire Mouse Pokémon, is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection. Doesn’t its shyness make you want to cuddle it even more?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_1_totodile
TEXT: Totodile, the Big Jaw Pokémon, is small but rough and tough. It won’t hesitate to take a bite out of anything that moves. Though what’s the harm in one quick pet...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_2_2
TEXT: I’m sure this little one is eager to spend some time with you, and what better way than letting it join you on your Johto-inspired journey!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_chikorita
TEXT: Wow, your Chikorita evolved into Bayleef already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_cyndaquil
TEXT: Wow, your Cyndaquil evolved into Quilava already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_0_totodile
TEXT: Wow, your Totodile evolved into Croconaw already! And just in time, %PLAYERNAME%—I have some troubling news.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket is mobilizing—and they’re headed straight toward us!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: I have a feeling they’re stirring up more than just a mild bit of mischief... That must be why they’re launching an invasion—more distractions! Not to mention they always love to crash our parties.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Have they heard about the Celebi sightings? Or maybe they have something even more sinister up their sleeve...

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_3_4
TEXT: I’m going to need your help defeating some Team GO Rocket Grunts—distract the distraction, and buy me some time to investigate. Can I count on your help?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Magnificent work, %PLAYERNAME%! While I was investigating, some Team GO Rocket Grunts ran by, whining about losing to an “unfairly strong Trainer.”

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: I assume you’re the Trainer in question? Haha, but of course! I knew I could trust you.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_2
TEXT: So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn’t at all like your typical Gyarados.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_3
TEXT: This one seems like it’s mired in a fit of rage—not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region’s Lake of Rage.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_4
TEXT: Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_5
TEXT: Hm. That sounds similar to Shadow Pokémon, don’t you think? And there have been a lot more Shadow Pokémon appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_6
TEXT: And is this connected to what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they’ve now amplified and corrupted...?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_7
TEXT: And with Celebi about and its time travel powers— Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There’s no time to waste. Let’s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it’s too late!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you’ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: It looks like Team GO Rocket’s retreating as well, so how about we continue with our festivities? They’ve stolen enough of our time.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_chikorita
TEXT: I think your Bayleef would like to play with you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_cyndaquil
TEXT: I think your Quilava would like to play with you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_totodile
TEXT: I think your Croconaw would like to play with you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_3
TEXT: Even in the direst of situations, when you’re pulled from all sides, it’s essential to take time to decompress and enjoy a peaceful moment with your friends.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_4
TEXT: Times like that give us the strength to persevere.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_chikorita
TEXT: Speaking of strength, your Bayleef looks ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_cyndaquil
TEXT: Speaking of strength, your Quilava looks ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_totodile
TEXT: Speaking of strength, your Croconaw looks ready to evolve!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_chikorita
TEXT: Ah, your Meganium is absolutely efflorescent with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to see your friendship blossom.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_cyndaquil
TEXT: Ah, your Typhlosion is absolutely ablaze with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to see your new friendship burn so brightly.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_totodile
TEXT: Ah, your Feraligatr is absolutely awash with happiness! Are you two having fun? It’s been a delight to experience the refreshing friendship between you two.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_1
TEXT: Making new friends and exploring the world around you are two of life’s greatest joys. My life is richer for the adventures I’ve had.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_2
TEXT: I’d have never found that mysterious door if not for a random adventure! Despite Team GO Rocket’s interference, I’m still grateful for the time I got to spend with the team leaders and the research I was able to do.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_3
TEXT: Enough of my chatter—why don’t you go make some new friends yourself? There’s plenty of day left to enjoy.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, sorry to rush you, but we have to hurry! There’s been a confirmed Celebi sighting just moments ago. If you go now, you might be able to catch it!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_1
TEXT: Let’s GO!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_0
TEXT: Great work catching Celebi! It is thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_1
TEXT: I wonder why Celebi decided to appear to us today. Maybe it’s a sign of good things to come.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_2
TEXT: After all the trouble we’ve had with Team GO Rocket, I welcome the reminder that peaceful times aren’t too far off.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_3
TEXT: While you were out, I uncovered the truth Team GO Rocket has been trying so hard to hide: they’ve captured Lugia and Ho-Oh.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_4
TEXT: It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they’ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pokémon we’ve ever seen.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_5
TEXT: They’re calling them Apex Shadow Lugia and Apex Shadow Ho-Oh. Get ready, %PLAYERNAME%—the battle’s only just begun.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_0
TEXT: Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! How’d you enjoy yesterday’s festivities? I hope you’re still feeling energetic, because there’s more in store—and this time, we’re focusing on the Kanto region!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_1
TEXT: What better place to start one’s Pokémon adventure, no?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_2
TEXT: Now, let’s get out there and start exploring!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_0
TEXT: Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you’re looking a bit tired. Why not take a quick break? Play with your buddy a bit, maybe feed it a nice juicy Berry?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_1
TEXT: While you’re at it, why not grab a snack yourself! Even the strongest Trainers can’t run on an empty stomach.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_0
TEXT: Having fun, %PLAYERNAME%? Are you all warmed up for your next adventure? I hope so, because you’ll soon be exploring the area’s different habitats.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_1
TEXT: There are five habitats, each filled with unique Pokémon. Which habitats have which Pokémon, you ask? Well, let’s go find out!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_0
TEXT: Nice snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%! You really captured the essence of the Pokémon, and it looks like the little models were having a good time, too.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_1
TEXT: Did you enjoy your excursion through the habitats? I bet you encountered an immense amount of Pokémon, both familiar and new to you!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_2
TEXT: There are tons of amazing Trainers out here exploring as well.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_3
TEXT: Why not make a few new friends, then trade or battle with them?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were out, I heard that a powerful Legendary Pokémon has been sighted in the area.

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_1
TEXT: Maybe it heard about our festivities and wanted to join the fun? Let’s go check it out!

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_0
TEXT: Whoa! Is that...Mewtwo? Incredible! Will the world’s wonders never cease?

RESOURCE ID: sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_1
TEXT: This has been such a fun day, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you enjoy the rest of your adventure—there’s still plenty more to do. Until next time...let’s GO!
