# Pokemon GO Assets

Repository of all mined assets, including sprites, sounds, and news items. This repo is organized based on category and is a combination of downloaded/remote assets and assets found inside the APK.

## Folder Structure

### Images

All 2D images of all assets that we mine are located here. Assets are organized based on category, such as `Pokemon`, `Items`, `Backgrounds`, etc.

### 3D Assets

All 3D models and their textures (if present) of all assets that we mine are located here. Assets are organized based on category, such as `Pokemon`, `Items`, `Clothing`, etc.

### Sounds

All sound effects and music that are mined are found here. They are organized by category such as `Pokemon Moves`, `Music`, `Menu Sounds`, etc.

### Texts

Mined text assets which contain quests among other things will be found here. Inside there are two folders, one for `Latest APK` and one for `Latest Remote`. When Niantic pushes a text update, it's pushed to the Remote. Once a new APK is released, all remote pushes are merged into the APK and removed from the Remote; therefore, we maintain both.

**Note:** Keep in mind it is expected that the Remote will have items removed from it after a new APK is released.

### Candy Color Data

The JSON structure that the game uses to generate the in-game candy colors.
